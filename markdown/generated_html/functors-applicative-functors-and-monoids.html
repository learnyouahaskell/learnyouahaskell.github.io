<h1 id="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids">Functors, Applicative
Functors and Monoids</h1>
<p>Haskell’s combination of purity, higher order functions,
parameterized algebraic data types, and typeclasses allows us to
implement polymorphism on a much higher level than possible in other
languages. We don’t have to think about types belonging to a big
hierarchy of types. Instead, we think about what the types can act like
and then connect them with the appropriate typeclasses. An
<code>Int</code> can act like a lot of things. It can act like an
equatable thing, like an ordered thing, like an enumerable thing,
etc.</p>
<p>Typeclasses are open, which means that we can define our own data
type, think about what it can act like and connect it with the
typeclasses that define its behaviors. Because of that and because of
Haskell’s great type system that allows us to know a lot about a
function just by knowing its type declaration, we can define typeclasses
that define behavior that’s very general and abstract. We’ve met
typeclasses that define operations for seeing if two things are equal or
comparing two things by some ordering. Those are very abstract and
elegant behaviors, but we just don’t think of them as anything very
special because we’ve been dealing with them for most of our lives. We
recently met functors, which are basically things that can be mapped
over. That’s an example of a useful and yet still pretty abstract
property that typeclasses can describe. In this chapter, we’ll take a
closer look at functors, along with slightly stronger and more useful
versions of functors called applicative functors. We’ll also take a look
at monoids, which are sort of like socks.</p>

<p>We’ve already talked about functors in <a
href="making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses.html#the-functor-typeclass">their
own little section</a>. If you haven’t read it yet, you should probably
give it a glance right now, or maybe later when you have more time. Or
you can just pretend you read it.</p>
<p>Still, here’s a quick refresher: Functors are things that can be
mapped over, like lists, <code>Maybe</code>s, trees, and such. In
Haskell, they’re described by the typeclass <code>Functor</code>, which
has only one typeclass method, namely <code>fmap</code>, which has a
type of <code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>. It says:
give me a function that takes an <code>a</code> and returns a
<code>b</code> and a box with an <code>a</code> (or several of them)
inside it and I’ll give you a box with a <code>b</code> (or several of
them) inside it. It kind of applies the function to the element inside
the box.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>A word of advice.</strong> Many times the box analogy is used
to help you get some intuition for how functors work, and later, we’ll
probably use the same analogy for applicative functors and monads. It’s
an okay analogy that helps people understand functors at first, just
don’t take it too literally, because for some functors the box analogy
has to be stretched really thin to still hold some truth. A more correct
term for what a functor is would be <em>computational context</em>. The
context might be that the computation can have a value or it might have
failed (<code>Maybe</code> and <code>Either a</code>) or that there
might be more values (lists), stuff like that.</p>
</div>
<p>If we want to make a type constructor an instance of
<code>Functor</code>, it has to have a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>,
which means that it has to take exactly one concrete type as a type
parameter. For example, <code>Maybe</code> can be made an instance
because it takes one type parameter to produce a concrete type, like
<code>Maybe Int</code> or <code>Maybe String</code>. If a type
constructor takes two parameters, like <code>Either</code>, we have to
partially apply the type constructor until it only takes one type
parameter. So we can’t write <code>instance Functor Either where</code>,
but we can write <code>instance Functor (Either a) where</code> and then
if we imagine that <code>fmap</code> is only for <code>Either a</code>,
it would have a type declaration of
<code>fmap :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; Either a b -&gt; Either a c</code>. As
you can see, the <code>Either a</code> part is fixed, because
<code>Either a</code> takes only one type parameter, whereas just
<code>Either</code> takes two so
<code>fmap :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; Either b -&gt; Either c</code> wouldn’t
really make sense.</p>
<p>We’ve learned by now how a lot of types (well, type constructors
really) are instances of <code>Functor</code>, like <code>[]</code>,
<code>Maybe</code>, <code>Either a</code> and a <code>Tree</code> type
that we made on our own. We saw how we can map functions over them for
great good. In this section, we’ll take a look at two more instances of
functor, namely <code>IO</code> and <code>(-&gt;) r</code>.</p>
<p>If some value has a type of, say, <code>IO String</code>, that means
that it’s an I/O action that, when performed, will go out into the real
world and get some string for us, which it will yield as a result. We
can use <code>&lt;-</code> in <em>do</em> syntax to bind that result to
a name. We mentioned that I/O actions are like boxes with little feet
that go out and fetch some value from the outside world for us. We can
inspect what they fetched, but after inspecting, we have to wrap the
value back in <code>IO</code>. By thinking about this box with little
feet analogy, we can see how <code>IO</code> acts like a functor.</p>
<p>Let’s see how <code>IO</code> is an instance of <code>Functor</code>.
When we <code>fmap</code> a function over an I/O action, we want to get
back an I/O action that does the same thing, but has our function
applied over its result value.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor IO where
    fmap f action = do
        result &lt;- action
        return (f result)</code></pre>
<p>The result of mapping something over an I/O action will be an I/O
action, so right off the bat we use <em>do</em> syntax to glue two
actions and make a new one. In the implementation for <code>fmap</code>,
we make a new I/O action that first performs the original I/O action and
calls its result <code>result</code>. Then, we do
<code>return (f result)</code>. <code>return</code> is, as you know, a
function that makes an I/O action that doesn’t do anything but only
presents something as its result. The action that a <em>do</em> block
produces will always have the result value of its last action. That’s
why we use return to make an I/O action that doesn’t really do anything,
it just presents <code>f result</code> as the result of the new I/O
action.</p>
<p>We can play around with it to gain some intuition. It’s pretty simple
really. Check out this piece of code:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>main = do line &lt;- getLine
          let line&#39; = reverse line
          putStrLn $ &quot;You said &quot; ++ line&#39; ++ &quot; backwards!&quot;
          putStrLn $ &quot;Yes, you really said&quot; ++ line&#39; ++ &quot; backwards!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The user is prompted for a line and we give it back to the user, only
reversed. Here’s how to rewrite this by using <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>main = do line &lt;- fmap reverse getLine
          putStrLn $ &quot;You said &quot; ++ line ++ &quot; backwards!&quot;
          putStrLn $ &quot;Yes, you really said&quot; ++ line ++ &quot; backwards!&quot;</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/alien.png"
class="left" width="262" height="212" alt="w00ooOoooOO" /></p>
<p>Just like when we <code>fmap</code> <code>reverse</code> over
<code>Just "blah"</code> to get <code>Just "halb"</code>, we can
<code>fmap</code> <code>reverse</code> over <code>getLine</code>.
<code>getLine</code> is an I/O action that has a type of
<code>IO String</code> and mapping <code>reverse</code> over it gives us
an I/O action that will go out into the real world and get a line and
then apply <code>reverse</code> to its result. Like we can apply a
function to something that’s inside a <code>Maybe</code> box, we can
apply a function to what’s inside an <code>IO</code> box, only it has to
go out into the real world to get something. Then when we bind it to a
name by using <code>&lt;-</code>, the name will reflect the result that
already has <code>reverse</code> applied to it.</p>
<p>The I/O action <code>fmap (++"!") getLine</code> behaves just like
<code>getLine</code>, only that its result always has <code>"!"</code>
appended to it!</p>
<p>If we look at what <code>fmap</code>’s type would be if it were
limited to <code>IO</code>, it would be
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; IO a -&gt; IO b</code>.
<code>fmap</code> takes a function and an I/O action and returns a new
I/O action that’s like the old one, except that the function is applied
to its contained result.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself binding the result of an I/O action to a
name, only to apply a function to that and call that something else,
consider using <code>fmap</code>, because it looks prettier. If you want
to apply multiple transformations to some data inside a functor, you can
declare your own function at the top level, make a lambda function or
ideally, use function composition:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.Char
import Data.List

main = do line &lt;- fmap (intersperse &#39;-&#39; . reverse . map toUpper) getLine
          putStrLn line</code></pre>
<pre class="plain"><code>$ runhaskell fmapping_io.hs
hello there
E-R-E-H-T- -O-L-L-E-H</code></pre>
<p>As you probably know,
<code>intersperse '-' . reverse . map toUpper</code> is a function that
takes a string, maps <code>toUpper</code> over it, the applies
<code>reverse</code> to that result and then applies
<code>intersperse '-'</code> to that result. It’s like writing
<code>(\xs -&gt; intersperse '-' (reverse (map toUpper xs)))</code>,
only prettier.</p>
<p>Another instance of <code>Functor</code> that we’ve been dealing with
all along but didn’t know was a <code>Functor</code> is
<code>(-&gt;) r</code>. You’re probably slightly confused now, since
what the heck does <code>(-&gt;) r</code> mean? The function type
<code>r -&gt; a</code> can be rewritten as <code>(-&gt;) r a</code>,
much like we can write <code>2 + 3</code> as <code>(+) 2 3</code>. When
we look at it as <code>(-&gt;) r a</code>, we can see
<code>(-&gt;)</code> in a slightly different light, because we see that
it’s just a type constructor that takes two type parameters, just like
<code>Either</code>. But remember, we said that a type constructor has
to take exactly one type parameter so that it can be made an instance of
<code>Functor</code>. That’s why we can’t make <code>(-&gt;)</code> an
instance of <code>Functor</code>, but if we partially apply it to
<code>(-&gt;) r</code>, it doesn’t pose any problems. If the syntax
allowed for type constructors to be partially applied with sections
(like we can partially apply <code>+</code> by doing <code>(2+)</code>,
which is the same as <code>(+) 2</code>), you could write
<code>(-&gt;) r</code> as <code>(r -&gt;)</code>. How are functions
functors? Well, let’s take a look at the implementation, which lies in
<code>Control.Monad.Instances</code></p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>We usually mark functions that take anything and return anything as
<code>a -&gt; b</code>. <code>r -&gt; a</code> is the same thing, we
just used different letters for the type variables.</p>
</div>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) where
    fmap f g = (\x -&gt; f (g x))</code></pre>
<p>If the syntax allowed for it, it could have been written as</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor (r -&gt;) where
    fmap f g = (\x -&gt; f (g x))</code></pre>
<p>But it doesn’t, so we have to write it in the former fashion.</p>
<p>First of all, let’s think about <code>fmap</code>’s type. It’s
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>. Now what we’ll do
is mentally replace all the <code>f</code>’s, which are the role that
our functor instance plays, with <code>(-&gt;) r</code>’s. We’ll do that
to see how <code>fmap</code> should behave for this particular instance.
We get
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; ((-&gt;) r a) -&gt; ((-&gt;) r b)</code>.
Now what we can do is write the <code>(-&gt;) r a</code> and
<code>(-&gt; r b)</code> types as infix <code>r -&gt; a</code> and
<code>r -&gt; b</code>, like we normally do with functions. What we get
now is
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (r -&gt; a) -&gt; (r -&gt; b)</code>.</p>
<p>Hmmm OK. Mapping one function over a function has to produce a
function, just like mapping a function over a <code>Maybe</code> has to
produce a <code>Maybe</code> and mapping a function over a list has to
produce a list. What does the type
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (r -&gt; a) -&gt; (r -&gt; b)</code> for
this instance tell us? Well, we see that it takes a function from
<code>a</code> to <code>b</code> and a function from <code>r</code> to
<code>a</code> and returns a function from <code>r</code> to
<code>b</code>. Does this remind you of anything? Yes! Function
composition! We pipe the output of <code>r -&gt; a</code> into the input
of <code>a -&gt; b</code> to get a function <code>r -&gt; b</code>,
which is exactly what function composition is about. If you look at how
the instance is defined above, you’ll see that it’s just function
composition. Another way to write this instance would be:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor ((-&gt;) r) where
    fmap = (.)</code></pre>
<p>This makes the revelation that using <code>fmap</code> over functions
is just composition sort of obvious. Do
<code>:m + Control.Monad.Instances</code>, since that’s where the
instance is defined and then try playing with mapping over
functions.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t fmap (*3) (+100)
fmap (*3) (+100) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
ghci&gt; fmap (*3) (+100) 1
303
ghci&gt; (*3) `fmap` (+100) $ 1
303
ghci&gt; (*3) . (+100) $ 1
303
ghci&gt; fmap (show . (*3)) (*100) 1
&quot;300&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We can call <code>fmap</code> as an infix function so that the
resemblance to <code>.</code> is clear. In the second input line, we’re
mapping <code>(*3)</code> over <code>(+100)</code>, which results in a
function that will take an input, call <code>(+100)</code> on that and
then call <code>(*3)</code> on that result. We call that function with
<code>1</code>.</p>
<p>How does the box analogy hold here? Well, if you stretch it, it
holds. When we use <code>fmap (+3)</code> over <code>Just 3</code>, it’s
easy to imagine the <code>Maybe</code> as a box that has some contents
on which we apply the function <code>(+3)</code>. But what about when
we’re doing <code>fmap (*3) (+100)</code>? Well, you can think of the
function <code>(+100)</code> as a box that contains its eventual result.
Sort of like how an I/O action can be thought of as a box that will go
out into the real world and fetch some result. Using
<code>fmap (*3)</code> on <code>(+100)</code> will create another
function that acts like <code>(+100)</code>, only before producing a
result, <code>(*3)</code> will be applied to that result. Now we can see
how <code>fmap</code> acts just like <code>.</code> for functions.</p>
<p>The fact that <code>fmap</code> is function composition when used on
functions isn’t so terribly useful right now, but at least it’s very
interesting. It also bends our minds a bit and let us see how things
that act more like computations than boxes (<code>IO</code> and
<code>(-&gt;) r</code>) can be functors. The function being mapped over
a computation results in the same computation but the result of that
computation is modified with the function.</p>
<p><img

class="right" width="443" height="450"
alt="lifting a function is easier than lifting a million pounds" /></p>
<p>Before we go on to the rules that <code>fmap</code> should follow,
let’s think about the type of <code>fmap</code> once more. Its type is
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>. We’re missing the
class constraint <code>(Functor f) =&gt;</code>, but we left it out here
for brevity, because we’re talking about functors anyway so we know what
the <code>f</code> stands for. When we first learned about <a
href="higher-order-functions.html#curried-functions">curried
functions</a>, we said that all Haskell functions actually take one
parameter. A function <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> actually takes just
one parameter of type <code>a</code> and then returns a function
<code>b -&gt; c</code>, which takes one parameter and returns a
<code>c</code>. That’s how if we call a function with too few parameters
(i.e. partially apply it), we get back a function that takes the number
of parameters that we left out (if we’re thinking about functions as
taking several parameters again). So <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> can
be written as <code>a -&gt; (b -&gt; c)</code>, to make the currying
more apparent.</p>
<p>In the same vein, if we write
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b)</code>, we can think of
<code>fmap</code> not as a function that takes one function and a
functor and returns a functor, but as a function that takes a function
and returns a new function that’s just like the old one, only it takes a
functor as a parameter and returns a functor as the result. It takes an
<code>a -&gt; b</code> function and returns a function
<code>f a -&gt; f b</code>. This is called <em>lifting</em> a function.
Let’s play around with that idea by using GHCI’s <code>:t</code>
command:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t fmap (*2)
fmap (*2) :: (Num a, Functor f) =&gt; f a -&gt; f a
ghci&gt; :t fmap (replicate 3)
fmap (replicate 3) :: (Functor f) =&gt; f a -&gt; f [a]</code></pre>
<p>The expression <code>fmap (*2)</code> is a function that takes a
functor <code>f</code> over numbers and returns a functor over numbers.
That functor can be a list, a <code>Maybe</code>, an
<code>Either String</code>, whatever. The expression
<code>fmap (replicate 3)</code> will take a functor over any type and
return a functor over a list of elements of that type.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>When we say <em>a functor over numbers</em>, you can think of that as
<em>a functor that has numbers in it</em>. The former is a bit fancier
and more technically correct, but the latter is usually easier to
get.</p>
</div>
<p>This is even more apparent if we partially apply, say,
<code>fmap (++"!")</code> and then bind it to a name in GHCI.</p>
<p>You can think of <code>fmap</code> as either a function that takes a
function and a functor and then maps that function over the functor, or
you can think of it as a function that takes a function and lifts that
function so that it operates on functors. Both views are correct and in
Haskell, equivalent.</p>
<p>The type
<code>fmap (replicate 3) :: (Functor f) =&gt; f a -&gt; f [a]</code>
means that the function will work on any functor. What exactly it will
do depends on which functor we use it on. If we use
<code>fmap (replicate 3)</code> on a list, the list’s implementation for
<code>fmap</code> will be chosen, which is just <code>map</code>. If we
use it on a <code>Maybe a</code>, it’ll apply <code>replicate 3</code>
to the value inside the <code>Just</code>, or if it’s
<code>Nothing</code>, then it stays <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap (replicate 3) [1,2,3,4]
[[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]]
ghci&gt; fmap (replicate 3) (Just 4)
Just [4,4,4]
ghci&gt; fmap (replicate 3) (Right &quot;blah&quot;)
Right [&quot;blah&quot;,&quot;blah&quot;,&quot;blah&quot;]
ghci&gt; fmap (replicate 3) Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; fmap (replicate 3) (Left &quot;foo&quot;)
Left &quot;foo&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next up, we’re going to look at the <strong>functor laws</strong>. In
order for something to be a functor, it should satisfy some laws. All
functors are expected to exhibit certain kinds of functor-like
properties and behaviors. They should reliably behave as things that can
be mapped over. Calling <code>fmap</code> on a functor should just map a
function over the functor, nothing more. This behavior is described in
the functor laws. There are two of them that all instances of
<code>Functor</code> should abide by. They aren’t enforced by Haskell
automatically, so you have to test them out yourself.</p>
<p><strong>The first functor law states that if we map the
<code>id</code> function over a functor, the functor that we get back
should be the same as the original functor.</strong> If we write that a
bit more formally, it means that <code
class="label law">fmap id = id</code>. So essentially, this says that if
we do <code>fmap id</code> over a functor, it should be the same as just
calling <code>id</code> on the functor. Remember, <code>id</code> is the
identity function, which just returns its parameter unmodified. It can
also be written as <code>\x -&gt; x</code>. If we view the functor as
something that can be mapped over, the <code
class="label law">fmap id = id</code> law seems kind of trivial or
obvious.</p>
<p>Let’s see if this law holds for a few values of functors.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap id (Just 3)
Just 3
ghci&gt; id (Just 3)
Just 3
ghci&gt; fmap id [1..5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
ghci&gt; id [1..5]
[1,2,3,4,5]
ghci&gt; fmap id []
[]
ghci&gt; fmap id Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>If we look at the implementation of <code>fmap</code> for, say,
<code>Maybe</code>, we can figure out why the first functor law
holds.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
    fmap f Nothing = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>We imagine that <code>id</code> plays the role of the <code>f</code>
parameter in the implementation. We see that if wee <code>fmap id</code>
over <code>Just x</code>, the result will be <code>Just (id x)</code>,
and because <code>id</code> just returns its parameter, we can deduce
that <code>Just (id x)</code> equals <code>Just x</code>. So now we know
that if we map <code>id</code> over a <code>Maybe</code> value with a
<code>Just</code> value constructor, we get that same value back.</p>
<p>Seeing that mapping <code>id</code> over a <code>Nothing</code> value
returns the same value is trivial. So from these two equations in the
implementation for <code>fmap</code>, we see that the law
<code>fmap id = id</code> holds.</p>
<p><img

class="left" width="345" height="428"
alt="justice is blind, but so is my dog" /></p>
<p><strong>The second law says that composing two functions and then
mapping the resulting function over a functor should be the same as
first mapping one function over the functor and then mapping the other
one.</strong> Formally written, that means that <code
class="label law">fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g</code>. Or to write it
in another way, for any functor <em>F</em>, the following should hold:
<code class="label law">fmap (f . g) F = fmap f (fmap g F)</code>.</p>
<p>If we can show that some type obeys both functor laws, we can rely on
it having the same fundamental behaviors as other functors when it comes
to mapping. We can know that when we use <code>fmap</code> on it, there
won’t be anything other than mapping going on behind the scenes and that
it will act like a thing that can be mapped over, i.e. a functor. You
figure out how the second law holds for some type by looking at the
implementation of <code>fmap</code> for that type and then using the
method that we used to check if <code>Maybe</code> obeys the first
law.</p>
<p>If you want, we can check out how the second functor law holds for
<code>Maybe</code>. If we do <code>fmap (f . g)</code> over
<code>Nothing</code>, we get <code>Nothing</code>, because doing a
<code>fmap</code> with any function over <code>Nothing</code> returns
<code>Nothing</code>. If we do <code>fmap f (fmap g Nothing)</code>, we
get <code>Nothing</code>, for the same reason. OK, seeing how the second
law holds for <code>Maybe</code> if it’s a <code>Nothing</code> value is
pretty easy, almost trivial.</p>
<p>How about if it’s a <code>Just <em>something</em></code> value? Well,
if we do <code>fmap (f . g) (Just x)</code>, we see from the
implementation that it’s implemented as <code>Just ((f . g) x)</code>,
which is, of course, <code>Just (f (g x))</code>. If we do
<code>fmap f (fmap g (Just x))</code>, we see from the implementation
that <code>fmap g (Just x)</code> is <code>Just (g x)</code>. Ergo,
<code>fmap f (fmap g (Just x))</code> equals
<code>fmap f (Just (g x))</code> and from the implementation we see that
this equals <code>Just (f (g x))</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re a bit confused by this proof, don’t worry. Be sure that you
understand how <a
href="higher-order-functions.html#composition">function composition</a>
works. Many times, you can intuitively see how these laws hold because
the types act like containers or functions. You can also just try them
on a bunch of different values of a type and be able to say with some
certainty that a type does indeed obey the laws.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a pathological example of a type constructor
being an instance of the <code>Functor</code> typeclass but not really
being a functor, because it doesn’t satisfy the laws. Let’s say that we
have a type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data CMaybe a = CNothing | CJust Int a deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>The C here stands for <em>counter</em>. It’s a data type that looks
much like <code>Maybe a</code>, only the <code>Just</code> part holds
two fields instead of one. The first field in the <code>CJust</code>
value constructor will always have a type of <code>Int</code>, and it
will be some sort of counter and the second field is of type
<code>a</code>, which comes from the type parameter and its type will,
of course, depend on the concrete type that we choose for
<code>CMaybe a</code>. Let’s play with our new type to get some
intuition for it.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; CNothing
CNothing
ghci&gt; CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot;
CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot;
ghci&gt; :t CNothing
CNothing :: CMaybe a
ghci&gt; :t CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot;
CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot; :: CMaybe [Char]
ghci&gt; CJust 100 [1,2,3]
CJust 100 [1,2,3]</code></pre>
<p>If we use the <code>CNothing</code> constructor, there are no fields,
and if we use the <code>CJust</code> constructor, the first field is an
integer and the second field can be any type. Let’s make this an
instance of <code>Functor</code> so that every time we use
<code>fmap</code>, the function gets applied to the second field,
whereas the first field gets increased by 1.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor CMaybe where
    fmap f CNothing = CNothing
    fmap f (CJust counter x) = CJust (counter+1) (f x)</code></pre>
<p>This is kind of like the instance implementation for
<code>Maybe</code>, except that when we do <code>fmap</code> over a
value that doesn’t represent an empty box (a <code>CJust</code> value),
we don’t just apply the function to the contents, we also increase the
counter by 1. Everything seems cool so far, we can even play with this a
bit:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap (++&quot;ha&quot;) (CJust 0 &quot;ho&quot;)
CJust 1 &quot;hoha&quot;
ghci&gt; fmap (++&quot;he&quot;) (fmap (++&quot;ha&quot;) (CJust 0 &quot;ho&quot;))
CJust 2 &quot;hohahe&quot;
ghci&gt; fmap (++&quot;blah&quot;) CNothing
CNothing</code></pre>
<p>Does this obey the functor laws? In order to see that something
doesn’t obey a law, it’s enough to find just one counter-example.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap id (CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot;)
CJust 1 &quot;haha&quot;
ghci&gt; id (CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot;)
CJust 0 &quot;haha&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Ah! We know that the first functor law states that if we map
<code>id</code> over a functor, it should be the same as just calling
<code>id</code> with the same functor, but as we’ve seen from this
example, this is not true for our <code>CMaybe</code> functor. Even
though it’s part of the <code>Functor</code> typeclass, it doesn’t obey
the functor laws and is therefore not a functor. If someone used our
<code>CMaybe</code> type as a functor, they would expect it to obey the
functor laws like a good functor. But <code>CMaybe</code> fails at being
a functor even though it pretends to be one, so using it as a functor
might lead to some faulty code. When we use a functor, it shouldn’t
matter if we first compose a few functions and then map them over the
functor or if we just map each function over a functor in succession.
But with <code>CMaybe</code>, it matters, because it keeps track of how
many times it’s been mapped over. Not cool! If we wanted
<code>CMaybe</code> to obey the functor laws, we’d have to make it so
that the <code>Int</code> field stays the same when we use
<code>fmap</code>.</p>
<p>At first, the functor laws might seem a bit confusing and
unnecessary, but then we see that if we know that a type obeys both
laws, we can make certain assumptions about how it will act. If a type
obeys the functor laws, we know that calling <code>fmap</code> on a
value of that type will only map the function over it, nothing more.
This leads to code that is more abstract and extensible, because we can
use laws to reason about behaviors that any functor should have and make
functions that operate reliably on any functor.</p>
<p>All the <code>Functor</code> instances in the standard library obey
these laws, but you can check for yourself if you don’t believe me. And
the next time you make a type an instance of <code>Functor</code>, take
a minute to make sure that it obeys the functor laws. Once you’ve dealt
with enough functors, you kind of intuitively see the properties and
behaviors that they have in common and it’s not hard to intuitively see
if a type obeys the functor laws. But even without the intuition, you
can always just go over the implementation line by line and see if the
laws hold or try to find a counter-example.</p>
<p>We can also look at functors as things that output values in a
context. For instance, <code>Just 3</code> outputs the value
<code>3</code> in the context that it might or not output any values at
all. <code>[1,2,3]</code> outputs three values—<code>1</code>,
<code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>, the context is that there may be
multiple values or no values. The function <code>(+3)</code> will output
a value, depending on which parameter it is given.</p>
<p>If you think of functors as things that output values, you can think
of mapping over functors as attaching a transformation to the output of
the functor that changes the value. When we do
<code>fmap (+3) [1,2,3]</code>, we attach the transformation
<code>(+3)</code> to the output of <code>[1,2,3]</code>, so whenever we
look at a number that the list outputs, <code>(+3)</code> will be
applied to it. Another example is mapping over functions. When we do
<code>fmap (+3) (*3)</code>, we attach the transformation
<code>(+3)</code> to the eventual output of <code>(*3)</code>. Looking
at it this way gives us some intuition as to why using <code>fmap</code>
on functions is just composition (<code>fmap (+3) (*3)</code> equals
<code>(+3) . (*3)</code>, which equals <code>\x -&gt; ((x*3)+3)</code>),
because we take a function like <code>(*3)</code> then we attach the
transformation <code>(+3)</code> to its output. The result is still a
function, only when we give it a number, it will be multiplied by three
and then it will go through the attached transformation where it will be
added to three. This is what happens with composition.</p>

<p>In this section, we’ll take a look at applicative functors, which are
beefed up functors, represented in Haskell by the
<code>Applicative</code> typeclass, found in the
<code>Control.Applicative</code> module.</p>
<p>As you know, functions in Haskell are curried by default, which means
that a function that seems to take several parameters actually takes
just one parameter and returns a function that takes the next parameter
and so on. If a function is of type <code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code>, we
usually say that it takes two parameters and returns a <code>c</code>,
but actually it takes an <code>a</code> and returns a function
<code>b -&gt; c</code>. That’s why we can call a function as
<code>f x y</code> or as <code>(f x) y</code>. This mechanism is what
enables us to partially apply functions by just calling them with too
few parameters, which results in functions that we can then pass on to
other functions.</p>
<p>So far, when we were mapping functions over functors, we usually
mapped functions that take only one parameter. But what happens when we
map a function like <code>*</code>, which takes two parameters, over a
functor? Let’s take a look at a couple of concrete examples of this. If
we have <code>Just 3</code> and we do <code>fmap (*) (Just 3)</code>,
what do we get? From the instance implementation of <code>Maybe</code>
for <code>Functor</code>, we know that if it’s a <code>Just
<em>something</em></code> value, it will apply the function to the
<code><em>something</em></code> inside the <code>Just</code>. Therefore,
doing <code>fmap (*) (Just 3)</code> results in
<code>Just ((*) 3)</code>, which can also be written as
<code>Just (* 3)</code> if we use sections. Interesting! We get a
function wrapped in a <code>Just</code>!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t fmap (++) (Just &quot;hey&quot;)
fmap (++) (Just &quot;hey&quot;) :: Maybe ([Char] -&gt; [Char])
ghci&gt; :t fmap compare (Just &#39;a&#39;)
fmap compare (Just &#39;a&#39;) :: Maybe (Char -&gt; Ordering)
ghci&gt; :t fmap compare &quot;A LIST OF CHARS&quot;
fmap compare &quot;A LIST OF CHARS&quot; :: [Char -&gt; Ordering]
ghci&gt; :t fmap (\x y z -&gt; x + y / z) [3,4,5,6]
fmap (\x y z -&gt; x + y / z) [3,4,5,6] :: (Fractional a) =&gt; [a -&gt; a -&gt; a]</code></pre>
<p>If we map <code>compare</code>, which has a type of
<code>(Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering</code> over a list of
characters, we get a list of functions of type
<code>Char -&gt; Ordering</code>, because the function
<code>compare</code> gets partially applied with the characters in the
list. It’s not a list of <code>(Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering</code>
function, because the first <code>a</code> that got applied was a
<code>Char</code> and so the second <code>a</code> has to decide to be
of type <code>Char</code>.</p>
<p>We see how by mapping “multi-parameter” functions over functors, we
get functors that contain functions inside them. So now what can we do
with them? Well for one, we can map functions that take these functions
as parameters over them, because whatever is inside a functor will be
given to the function that we’re mapping over it as a parameter.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let a = fmap (*) [1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; :t a
a :: [Integer -&gt; Integer]
ghci&gt; fmap (\f -&gt; f 9) a
[9,18,27,36]</code></pre>
<p>But what if we have a functor value of <code>Just (3 *)</code> and a
functor value of <code>Just 5</code> and we want to take out the
function from <code>Just (3 *)</code> and map it over
<code>Just 5</code>? With normal functors, we’re out of luck, because
all they support is just mapping normal functions over existing
functors. Even when we mapped <code>\f -&gt; f 9</code> over a functor
that contained functions inside it, we were just mapping a normal
function over it. But we can’t map a function that’s inside a functor
over another functor with what <code>fmap</code> offers us. We could
pattern-match against the <code>Just</code> constructor to get the
function out of it and then map it over <code>Just 5</code>, but we’re
looking for a more general and abstract way of doing that, which works
across functors.</p>
<p>Meet the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass. It lies in the
<code>Control.Applicative</code> module and it defines two methods,
<code>pure</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>. It doesn’t provide a
default implementation for any of them, so we have to define them both
if we want something to be an applicative functor. The class is defined
like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class (Functor f) =&gt; Applicative f where
    pure :: a -&gt; f a
    (&lt;*&gt;) :: f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>This simple three line class definition tells us a lot! Let’s start
at the first line. It starts the definition of the
<code>Applicative</code> class and it also introduces a class
constraint. It says that if we want to make a type constructor part of
the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass, it has to be in
<code>Functor</code> first. That’s why if we know that if a type
constructor is part of the <code>Applicative</code> typeclass, it’s also
in <code>Functor</code>, so we can use <code>fmap</code> on it.</p>
<p>The first method it defines is called <code>pure</code>. Its type
declaration is <code>pure :: a -&gt; f a</code>. <code>f</code> plays
the role of our applicative functor instance here. Because Haskell has a
very good type system and because everything a function can do is take
some parameters and return some value, we can tell a lot from a type
declaration and this is no exception. <code>pure</code> should take a
value of any type and return an applicative functor with that value
inside it. When we say <em>inside it</em>, we’re using the box analogy
again, even though we’ve seen that it doesn’t always stand up to
scrutiny. But the <code>a -&gt; f a</code> type declaration is still
pretty descriptive. We take a value and we wrap it in an applicative
functor that has that value as the result inside it.</p>
<p>A better way of thinking about <code>pure</code> would be to say that
it takes a value and puts it in some sort of default (or pure) context—a
minimal context that still yields that value.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> function is really interesting. It has a
type declaration of <code>f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>. Does
this remind you of anything? Of course,
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>. It’s a sort of a
beefed up <code>fmap</code>. Whereas <code>fmap</code> takes a function
and a functor and applies the function inside the functor,
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> takes a functor that has a function in it and
another functor and sort of extracts that function from the first
functor and then maps it over the second one. When I say
<em>extract</em>, I actually sort of mean <em>run</em> and then extract,
maybe even <em>sequence</em>. We’ll see why soon.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the <code>Applicative</code> instance
implementation for <code>Maybe</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Applicative Maybe where
    pure = Just
    Nothing &lt;*&gt; _ = Nothing
    (Just f) &lt;*&gt; something = fmap f something</code></pre>
<p>Again, from the class definition we see that the <code>f</code> that
plays the role of the applicative functor should take one concrete type
as a parameter, so we write
<code>instance Applicative Maybe where</code> instead of writing
<code>instance Applicative (Maybe a) where</code>.</p>
<p>First off, <code>pure</code>. We said earlier that it’s supposed to
take something and wrap it in an applicative functor. We wrote
<code>pure = Just</code>, because value constructors like
<code>Just</code> are normal functions. We could have also written
<code>pure x = Just x</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, we have the definition for <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>. We can’t
extract a function out of a <code>Nothing</code>, because it has no
function inside it. So we say that if we try to extract a function from
a <code>Nothing</code>, the result is a <code>Nothing</code>. If you
look at the class definition for <code>Applicative</code>, you’ll see
that there’s a <code>Functor</code> class constraint, which means that
we can assume that both of <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>’s parameters are
functors. If the first parameter is not a <code>Nothing</code>, but a
<code>Just</code> with some function inside it, we say that we then want
to map that function over the second parameter. This also takes care of
the case where the second parameter is <code>Nothing</code>, because
doing <code>fmap</code> with any function over a <code>Nothing</code>
will return a <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>So for <code>Maybe</code>, <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> extracts the
function from the left value if it’s a <code>Just</code> and maps it
over the right value. If any of the parameters is <code>Nothing</code>,
<code>Nothing</code> is the result.</p>
<p>OK cool great. Let’s give this a whirl.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 9
Just 12
ghci&gt; pure (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 10
Just 13
ghci&gt; pure (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 9
Just 12
ghci&gt; Just (++&quot;hahah&quot;) &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; Nothing &lt;*&gt; Just &quot;woot&quot;
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>We see how doing <code>pure (+3)</code> and <code>Just (+3)</code> is
the same in this case. Use <code>pure</code> if you’re dealing with
<code>Maybe</code> values in an applicative context (i.e. using them
with <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>), otherwise stick to <code>Just</code>. The
first four input lines demonstrate how the function is extracted and
then mapped, but in this case, they could have been achieved by just
mapping unwrapped functions over functors. The last line is interesting,
because we try to extract a function from a <code>Nothing</code> and
then map it over something, which of course results in a
<code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>With normal functors, you can just map a function over a functor and
then you can’t get the result out in any general way, even if the result
is a partially applied function. Applicative functors, on the other
hand, allow you to operate on several functors with a single function.
Check out this piece of code:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; pure (+) &lt;*&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 5
Just 8
ghci&gt; pure (+) &lt;*&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; pure (+) &lt;*&gt; Nothing &lt;*&gt; Just 5
Nothing</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/whale.png"
class="right" width="214" height="177" alt="whaale" /></p>
<p>What’s going on here? Let’s take a look, step by step.
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is left-associative, which means that
<code>pure (+) &lt;*&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 5</code> is the same as
<code>(pure (+) &lt;*&gt; Just 3) &lt;*&gt; Just 5</code>. First, the
<code>+</code> function is put in a functor, which is in this case a
<code>Maybe</code> value that contains the function. So at first, we
have <code>pure (+)</code>, which is <code>Just (+)</code>. Next,
<code>Just (+) &lt;*&gt; Just 3</code> happens. The result of this is
<code>Just (3+)</code>. This is because of partial application. Only
applying <code>3</code> to the <code>+</code> function results in a
function that takes one parameter and adds 3 to it. Finally,
<code>Just (3+) &lt;*&gt; Just 5</code> is carried out, which results in
a <code>Just 8</code>.</p>
<p>Isn’t this awesome?! Applicative functors and the applicative style
of doing <code>pure f &lt;*&gt; x &lt;*&gt; y &lt;*&gt; ...</code> allow
us to take a function that expects parameters that aren’t necessarily
wrapped in functors and use that function to operate on several values
that are in functor contexts. The function can take as many parameters
as we want, because it’s always partially applied step by step between
occurences of <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This becomes even more handy and apparent if we consider the fact
that <code>pure f &lt;*&gt; x</code> equals <code>fmap f x</code>. This
is one of the applicative laws. We’ll take a closer look at them later,
but for now, we can sort of intuitively see that this is so. Think about
it, it makes sense. Like we said before, <code>pure</code> puts a value
in a default context. If we just put a function in a default context and
then extract and apply it to a value inside another applicative functor,
we did the same as just mapping that function over that applicative
functor. Instead of writing
<code>pure f &lt;*&gt; x &lt;*&gt; y &lt;*&gt; ...</code>, we can write
<code>fmap f x &lt;*&gt; y &lt;*&gt; ...</code>. This is why
<code>Control.Applicative</code> exports a function called
<code>&lt;$&gt;</code>, which is just <code>fmap</code> as an infix
operator. Here’s how it’s defined:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&lt;$&gt;) :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
f &lt;$&gt; x = fmap f x</code></pre>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Yo!</strong> Quick reminder: type variables are independent
of parameter names or other value names. The <code>f</code> in the
function declaration here is a type variable with a class constraint
saying that any type constructor that replaces <code>f</code> should be
in the <code>Functor</code> typeclass. The <code>f</code> in the
function body denotes a function that we map over <code>x</code>. The
fact that we used <code>f</code> to represent both of those doesn’t mean
that they somehow represent the same thing.</p>
</div>
<p>By using <code>&lt;$&gt;</code>, the applicative style really shines,
because now if we want to apply a function <code>f</code> between three
applicative functors, we can write
<code>f &lt;$&gt; x &lt;*&gt; y &lt;*&gt; z</code>. If the parameters
weren’t applicative functors but normal values, we’d write
<code>f x y z</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at how this works. We have a value of
<code>Just "johntra"</code> and a value of <code>Just "volta"</code> and
we want to join them into one <code>String</code> inside a
<code>Maybe</code> functor. We do this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; Just &quot;johntra&quot; &lt;*&gt; Just &quot;volta&quot;
Just &quot;johntravolta&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Before we see how this happens, compare the above line with this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (++) &quot;johntra&quot; &quot;volta&quot;
&quot;johntravolta&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! To use a normal function on applicative functors, just
sprinkle some <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> about
and the function will operate on applicatives and return an applicative.
How cool is that?</p>
<p>Anyway, when we do
<code>(++) &lt;$&gt; Just "johntra" &lt;*&gt; Just "volta"</code>, first
<code>(++)</code>, which has a type of
<code>(++) :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code> gets mapped over
<code>Just "johntra"</code>, resulting in a value that’s the same as
<code>Just ("johntra"++)</code> and has a type of
<code>Maybe ([Char] -&gt; [Char])</code>. Notice how the first parameter
of <code>(++)</code> got eaten up and how the <code>a</code>s turned
into <code>Char</code>s. And now
<code>Just ("johntra"++) &lt;*&gt; Just "volta"</code> happens, which
takes the function out of the <code>Just</code> and maps it over
<code>Just "volta"</code>, resulting in
<code>Just "johntravolta"</code>. Had any of the two values been
<code>Nothing</code>, the result would have also been
<code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>So far, we’ve only used <code>Maybe</code> in our examples and you
might be thinking that applicative functors are all about
<code>Maybe</code>. There are loads of other instances of
<code>Applicative</code>, so let’s go and meet them!</p>
<p>Lists (actually the list type constructor, <code>[]</code>) are
applicative functors. What a surprise! Here’s how <code>[]</code> is an
instance of <code>Applicative</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Applicative [] where
    pure x = [x]
    fs &lt;*&gt; xs = [f x | f &lt;- fs, x &lt;- xs]</code></pre>
<p>Earlier, we said that <code>pure</code> takes a value and puts it in
a default context. Or in other words, a minimal context that still
yields that value. The minimal context for lists would be the empty
list, <code>[]</code>, but the empty list represents the lack of a
value, so it can’t hold in itself the value that we used
<code>pure</code> on. That’s why <code>pure</code> takes a value and
puts it in a singleton list. Similarly, the minimal context for the
<code>Maybe</code> applicative functor would be a <code>Nothing</code>,
but it represents the lack of a value instead of a value, so
<code>pure</code> is implemented as <code>Just</code> in the instance
implementation for <code>Maybe</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; pure &quot;Hey&quot; :: [String]
[&quot;Hey&quot;]
ghci&gt; pure &quot;Hey&quot; :: Maybe String
Just &quot;Hey&quot;</code></pre>
<p>What about <code>&lt;*&gt;</code>? If we look at what
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code>’s type would be if it were limited only to lists,
we get <code>(&lt;*&gt;) :: [a -&gt; b] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]</code>. It’s
implemented with a <a
href="starting-out.html#im-a-list-comprehension">list comprehension</a>.
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> has to somehow extract the function out of its
left parameter and then map it over the right parameter. But the thing
here is that the left list can have zero functions, one function, or
several functions inside it. The right list can also hold several
values. That’s why we use a list comprehension to draw from both lists.
We apply every possible function from the left list to every possible
value from the right list. The resulting list has every possible
combination of applying a function from the left list to a value in the
right one.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [(*0),(+100),(^2)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2,3]
[0,0,0,101,102,103,1,4,9]</code></pre>
<p>The left list has three functions and the right list has three
values, so the resulting list will have nine elements. Every function in
the left list is applied to every function in the right one. If we have
a list of functions that take two parameters, we can apply those
functions between two lists.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [(+),(*)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; [3,4]
[4,5,5,6,3,4,6,8]</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is left-associative,
<code>[(+),(*)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2]</code> happens first, resulting in a
list that’s the same as <code>[(1+),(2+),(1*),(2*)]</code>, because
every function on the left gets applied to every value on the right.
Then, <code>[(1+),(2+),(1*),(2*)] &lt;*&gt; [3,4]</code> happens, which
produces the final result.</p>
<p>Using the applicative style with lists is fun! Watch:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; [&quot;ha&quot;,&quot;heh&quot;,&quot;hmm&quot;] &lt;*&gt; [&quot;?&quot;,&quot;!&quot;,&quot;.&quot;]
[&quot;ha?&quot;,&quot;ha!&quot;,&quot;ha.&quot;,&quot;heh?&quot;,&quot;heh!&quot;,&quot;heh.&quot;,&quot;hmm?&quot;,&quot;hmm!&quot;,&quot;hmm.&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Again, see how we used a normal function that takes two strings
between two applicative functors of strings just by inserting the
appropriate applicative operators.</p>
<p>You can view lists as non-deterministic computations. A value like
<code>100</code> or <code>"what"</code> can be viewed as a deterministic
computation that has only one result, whereas a list like
<code>[1,2,3]</code> can be viewed as a computation that can’t decide on
which result it wants to have, so it presents us with all of the
possible results. So when you do something like
<code>(+) &lt;$&gt; [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt; [4,5,6]</code>, you can think of
it as adding together two non-deterministic computations with
<code>+</code>, only to produce another non-deterministic computation
that’s even less sure about its result.</p>
<p>Using the applicative style on lists is often a good replacement for
list comprehensions. In the second chapter, we wanted to see all the
possible products of <code>[2,5,10]</code> and <code>[8,10,11]</code>,
so we did this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [ x*y | x &lt;- [2,5,10], y &lt;- [8,10,11]]
[16,20,22,40,50,55,80,100,110]</code></pre>
<p>We’re just drawing from two lists and applying a function between
every combination of elements. This can be done in the applicative style
as well:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; [2,5,10] &lt;*&gt; [8,10,11]
[16,20,22,40,50,55,80,100,110]</code></pre>
<p>This seems clearer to me, because it’s easier to see that we’re just
calling <code>*</code> between two non-deterministic computations. If we
wanted all possible products of those two lists that are more than 50,
we’d just do:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; filter (&gt;50) $ (*) &lt;$&gt; [2,5,10] &lt;*&gt; [8,10,11]
[55,80,100,110]</code></pre>
<p>It’s easy to see how <code>pure f &lt;*&gt; xs</code> equals
<code>fmap f xs</code> with lists. <code>pure f</code> is just
<code>[f]</code> and <code>[f] &lt;*&gt; xs</code> will apply every
function in the left list to every value in the right one, but there’s
just one function in the left list, so it’s like mapping.</p>
<p>Another instance of <code>Applicative</code> that we’ve already
encountered is <code>IO</code>. This is how the instance is
implemented:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Applicative IO where
    pure = return
    a &lt;*&gt; b = do
        f &lt;- a
        x &lt;- b
        return (f x)</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/knight.png"
class="left" width="195" height="458" alt="ahahahah!" /></p>
<p>Since <code>pure</code> is all about putting a value in a minimal
context that still holds it as its result, it makes sense that
<code>pure</code> is just <code>return</code>, because
<code>return</code> does exactly that; it makes an I/O action that
doesn’t do anything, it just yields some value as its result, but it
doesn’t really do any I/O operations like printing to the terminal or
reading from a file.</p>
<p>If <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> were specialized for <code>IO</code> it
would have a type of
<code>(&lt;*&gt;) :: IO (a -&gt; b) -&gt; IO a -&gt; IO b</code>. It
would take an I/O action that yields a function as its result and
another I/O action and create a new I/O action from those two that, when
performed, first performs the first one to get the function and then
performs the second one to get the value and then it would yield that
function applied to the value as its result. We used <em>do</em> syntax
to implement it here. Remember, <em>do</em> syntax is about taking
several I/O actions and gluing them into one, which is exactly what we
do here.</p>
<p>With <code>Maybe</code> and <code>[]</code>, we could think of
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> as simply extracting a function from its left
parameter and then sort of applying it over the right one. With
<code>IO</code>, extracting is still in the game, but now we also have a
notion of <em>sequencing</em>, because we’re taking two I/O actions and
we’re sequencing, or gluing, them into one. We have to extract the
function from the first I/O action, but to extract a result from an I/O
action, it has to be performed.</p>
<p>Consider this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>myAction :: IO String
myAction = do
    a &lt;- getLine
    b &lt;- getLine
    return $ a ++ b</code></pre>
<p>This is an I/O action that will prompt the user for two lines and
yield as its result those two lines concatenated. We achieved it by
gluing together two <code>getLine</code> I/O actions and a
<code>return</code>, because we wanted our new glued I/O action to hold
the result of <code>a ++ b</code>. Another way of writing this would be
to use the applicative style.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>myAction :: IO String
myAction = (++) &lt;$&gt; getLine &lt;*&gt; getLine</code></pre>
<p>What we were doing before was making an I/O action that applied a
function between the results of two other I/O actions, and this is the
same thing. Remember, <code>getLine</code> is an I/O action with the
type <code>getLine :: IO String</code>. When we use
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> between two applicative functors, the result is
an applicative functor, so this all makes sense.</p>
<p>If we regress to the box analogy, we can imagine <code>getLine</code>
as a box that will go out into the real world and fetch us a string.
Doing <code>(++) &lt;$&gt; getLine &lt;*&gt; getLine</code> makes a new,
bigger box that sends those two boxes out to fetch lines from the
terminal and then presents the concatenation of those two lines as its
result.</p>
<p>The type of the expression
<code>(++) &lt;$&gt; getLine &lt;*&gt; getLine</code> is
<code>IO String</code>, which means that this expression is a completely
normal I/O action like any other, which also holds a result value inside
it, just like other I/O actions. That’s why we can do stuff like:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>main = do
    a &lt;- (++) &lt;$&gt; getLine &lt;*&gt; getLine
    putStrLn $ &quot;The two lines concatenated turn out to be: &quot; ++ a</code></pre>
<p>If you ever find yourself binding some I/O actions to names and then
calling some function on them and presenting that as the result by using
<code>return</code>, consider using the applicative style because it’s
arguably a bit more concise and terse.</p>
<p>Another instance of <code>Applicative</code> is
<code>(-&gt;) r</code>, so functions. They are rarely used with the
applicative style outside of code golf, but they’re still interesting as
applicatives, so let’s take a look at how the function instance is
implemented.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>If you’re confused about what <code>(-&gt;) r</code> means, check out
the previous section where we explain how <code>(-&gt;) r</code> is a
functor.</p>
</div>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Applicative ((-&gt;) r) where
    pure x = (\_ -&gt; x)
    f &lt;*&gt; g = \x -&gt; f x (g x)</code></pre>
<p>When we wrap a value into an applicative functor with
<code>pure</code>, the result it yields always has to be that value. A
minimal default context that still yields that value as a result. That’s
why in the function instance implementation, <code>pure</code> takes a
value and creates a function that ignores its parameter and always
returns that value. If we look at the type for <code>pure</code>, but
specialized for the <code>(-&gt;) r</code> instance, it’s
<code>pure :: a -&gt; (r -&gt; a)</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (pure 3) &quot;blah&quot;
3</code></pre>
<p>Because of currying, function application is left-associative, so we
can omit the parentheses.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; pure 3 &quot;blah&quot;
3</code></pre>
<p>The instance implementation for <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> is a bit
cryptic, so it’s best if we just take a look at how to use functions as
applicative functors in the applicative style.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t (+) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*100)
(+) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*100) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
ghci&gt; (+) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*100) $ 5
508</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> with two applicative functors results
in an applicative functor, so if we use it on two functions, we get back
a function. So what goes on here? When we do
<code>(+) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*100)</code>, we’re making a
function that will use <code>+</code> on the results of
<code>(+3)</code> and <code>(*100)</code> and return that. To
demonstrate on a real example, when we did
<code>(+) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*100) $ 5</code>, the <code>5</code>
first got applied to <code>(+3)</code> and <code>(*100)</code>,
resulting in <code>8</code> and <code>500</code>. Then, <code>+</code>
gets called with <code>8</code> and <code>500</code>, resulting in
<code>508</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (\x y z -&gt; [x,y,z]) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*2) &lt;*&gt; (/2) $ 5
[8.0,10.0,2.5]</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/jazzb.png"
class="right" width="400" height="230" alt="SLAP" /></p>
<p>Same here. We create a function that will call the function
<code>\x y z -&gt; [x,y,z]</code> with the eventual results from
<code>(+3)</code>, <code>(*2)</code> and <code>(/2)</code>. The
<code>5</code> gets fed to each of the three functions and then
<code>\x y z -&gt; [x, y, z]</code> gets called with those results.</p>
<p>You can think of functions as boxes that contain their eventual
results, so doing <code>k &lt;$&gt; f &lt;*&gt; g</code> creates a
function that will call <code>k</code> with the eventual results from
<code>f</code> and <code>g</code>. When we do something like
<code>(+) &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 5</code>, we’re using
<code>+</code> on values that might or might not be there, which also
results in a value that might or might not be there. When we do
<code>(+) &lt;$&gt; (+10) &lt;*&gt; (+5)</code>, we’re using
<code>+</code> on the future return values of <code>(+10)</code> and
<code>(+5)</code> and the result is also something that will produce a
value only when called with a parameter.</p>
<p>We don’t often use functions as applicatives, but this is still
really interesting. It’s not very important that you get how the
<code>(-&gt;) r</code> instance for <code>Applicative</code> works, so
don’t despair if you’re not getting this right now. Try playing with the
applicative style and functions to build up an intuition for functions
as applicatives.</p>
<p>An instance of <code>Applicative</code> that we haven’t encountered
yet is <code>ZipList</code>, and it lives in
<code>Control.Applicative</code>.</p>
<p>It turns out there are actually more ways for lists to be applicative
functors. One way is the one we already covered, which says that calling
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> with a list of functions and a list of values
results in a list which has all the possible combinations of applying
functions from the left list to the values in the right list. If we do
<code>[(+3),(*2)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2]</code>, <code>(+3)</code> will be
applied to both <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> and <code>(*2)</code>
will also be applied to both <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>,
resulting in a list that has four elements, namely
<code>[4,5,2,4]</code>.</p>
<p>However, <code>[(+3),(*2)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2]</code> could also work in
such a way that the first function in the left list gets applied to the
first value in the right one, the second function gets applied to the
second value, and so on. That would result in a list with two values,
namely <code>[4,4]</code>. You could look at it as
<code>[1 + 3, 2 * 2]</code>.</p>
<p>Because one type can’t have two instances for the same typeclass, the
<code>ZipList a</code> type was introduced, which has one constructor
<code>ZipList</code> that has just one field, and that field is a list.
Here’s the instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Applicative ZipList where
        pure x = ZipList (repeat x)
        ZipList fs &lt;*&gt; ZipList xs = ZipList (zipWith (\f x -&gt; f x) fs xs)</code></pre>
<p><code>&lt;*&gt;</code> does just what we said. It applies the first
function to the first value, the second function to the second value,
etc. This is done with <code>zipWith (\f x -&gt; f x) fs xs</code>.
Because of how <code>zipWith</code> works, the resulting list will be as
long as the shorter of the two lists.</p>
<p><code>pure</code> is also interesting here. It takes a value and puts
it in a list that just has that value repeating indefinitely.
<code>pure "haha"</code> results in
<code>ZipList (["haha","haha","haha"...</code>. This might be a bit
confusing since we said that <code>pure</code> should put a value in a
minimal context that still yields that value. And you might be thinking
that an infinite list of something is hardly minimal. But it makes sense
with zip lists, because it has to produce the value on every position.
This also satisfies the law that <code>pure f &lt;*&gt; xs</code> should
equal <code>fmap f xs</code>. If <code>pure 3</code> just returned
<code>ZipList [3]</code>,
<code>pure (*2) &lt;*&gt; ZipList [1,5,10]</code> would result in
<code>ZipList [2]</code>, because the resulting list of two zipped lists
has the length of the shorter of the two. If we zip a finite list with
an infinite list, the length of the resulting list will always be equal
to the length of the finite list.</p>
<p>So how do zip lists work in an applicative style? Let’s see. Oh, the
<code>ZipList a</code> type doesn’t have a <code>Show</code> instance,
so we have to use the <code class="label function">getZipList</code>
function to extract a raw list out of a zip list.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getZipList $ (+) &lt;$&gt; ZipList [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt; ZipList [100,100,100]
[101,102,103]
ghci&gt; getZipList $ (+) &lt;$&gt; ZipList [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt; ZipList [100,100..]
[101,102,103]
ghci&gt; getZipList $ max &lt;$&gt; ZipList [1,2,3,4,5,3] &lt;*&gt; ZipList [5,3,1,2]
[5,3,3,4]
ghci&gt; getZipList $ (,,) &lt;$&gt; ZipList &quot;dog&quot; &lt;*&gt; ZipList &quot;cat&quot; &lt;*&gt; ZipList &quot;rat&quot;
[(&#39;d&#39;,&#39;c&#39;,&#39;r&#39;),(&#39;o&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;a&#39;),(&#39;g&#39;,&#39;t&#39;,&#39;t&#39;)]</code></pre>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>The <code>(,,)</code> function is the same as
<code>\x y z -&gt; (x,y,z)</code>. Also, the <code>(,)</code> function
is the same as <code>\x y -&gt; (x,y)</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Aside from <code>zipWith</code>, the standard library has functions
such as <code>zipWith3</code>, <code>zipWith4</code>, all the way up to
7. <code>zipWith</code> takes a function that takes two parameters and
zips two lists with it. <code>zipWith3</code> takes a function that
takes three parameters and zips three lists with it, and so on. By using
zip lists with an applicative style, we don’t have to have a separate
zip function for each number of lists that we want to zip together. We
just use the applicative style to zip together an arbitrary amount of
lists with a function, and that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p><code>Control.Applicative</code> defines a function that’s called
<code class="label function">liftA2</code>, which has a type of
<code>liftA2 :: (Applicative f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c</code>
. It’s defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>liftA2 :: (Applicative f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c
liftA2 f a b = f &lt;$&gt; a &lt;*&gt; b</code></pre>
<p>Nothing special, it just applies a function between two applicatives,
hiding the applicative style that we’ve become familiar with. The reason
we’re looking at it is because it clearly showcases why applicative
functors are more powerful than just ordinary functors. With ordinary
functors, we can just map functions over one functor. But with
applicative functors, we can apply a function between several functors.
It’s also interesting to look at this function’s type as
<code>(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c)</code>. When
we look at it like this, we can say that <code>liftA2</code> takes a
normal binary function and promotes it to a function that operates on
two functors.</p>
<p>Here’s an interesting concept: we can take two applicative functors
and combine them into one applicative functor that has inside it the
results of those two applicative functors in a list. For instance, we
have <code>Just 3</code> and <code>Just 4</code>. Let’s assume that the
second one has a singleton list inside it, because that’s really easy to
achieve:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap (\x -&gt; [x]) (Just 4)
Just [4]</code></pre>
<p>OK, so let’s say we have <code>Just 3</code> and
<code>Just [4]</code>. How do we get <code>Just [3,4]</code>? Easy.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; liftA2 (:) (Just 3) (Just [4])
Just [3,4]
ghci&gt; (:) &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just [4]
Just [3,4]</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <code>:</code> is a function that takes an element and a
list and returns a new list with that element at the beginning. Now that
we have <code>Just [3,4]</code>, could we combine that with
<code>Just 2</code> to produce <code>Just [2,3,4]</code>? Of course we
could. It seems that we can combine any amount of applicatives into one
applicative that has a list of the results of those applicatives inside
it. Let’s try implementing a function that takes a list of applicatives
and returns an applicative that has a list as its result value. We’ll
call it <code>sequenceA</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sequenceA :: (Applicative f) =&gt; [f a] -&gt; f [a]
sequenceA [] = pure []
sequenceA (x:xs) = (:) &lt;$&gt; x &lt;*&gt; sequenceA xs</code></pre>
<p>Ah, recursion! First, we look at the type. It will transform a list
of applicatives into an applicative with a list. From that, we can lay
some groundwork for an edge condition. If we want to turn an empty list
into an applicative with a list of results, well, we just put an empty
list in a default context. Now comes the recursion. If we have a list
with a head and a tail (remember, <code>x</code> is an applicative and
<code>xs</code> is a list of them), we call <code>sequenceA</code> on
the tail, which results in an applicative with a list. Then, we just
prepend the value inside the applicative <code>x</code> into that
applicative with a list, and that’s it!</p>
<p>So if we do <code>sequenceA [Just 1, Just 2]</code>, that’s
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; Just 1 &lt;*&gt; sequenceA [Just 2]</code>. That
equals
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; Just 1 &lt;*&gt; ((:) &lt;$&gt; Just 2 &lt;*&gt; sequenceA [])</code>.
Ah! We know that <code>sequenceA []</code> ends up as being
<code>Just []</code>, so this expression is now
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; Just 1 &lt;*&gt; ((:) &lt;$&gt; Just 2 &lt;*&gt; Just [])</code>,
which is <code>(:) &lt;$&gt; Just 1 &lt;*&gt; Just [2]</code>, which is
<code>Just [1,2]</code>!</p>
<p>Another way to implement <code>sequenceA</code> is with a fold.
Remember, pretty much any function where we go over a list element by
element and accumulate a result along the way can be implemented with a
fold.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sequenceA :: (Applicative f) =&gt; [f a] -&gt; f [a]
sequenceA = foldr (liftA2 (:)) (pure [])</code></pre>
<p>We approach the list from the right and start off with an accumulator
value of <code>pure []</code>. We do <code>liftA2 (:)</code> between the
accumulator and the last element of the list, which results in an
applicative that has a singleton in it. Then we do
<code>liftA2 (:)</code> with the now last element and the current
accumulator and so on, until we’re left with just the accumulator, which
holds a list of the results of all the applicatives.</p>
<p>Let’s give our function a whirl on some applicatives.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; sequenceA [Just 3, Just 2, Just 1]
Just [3,2,1]
ghci&gt; sequenceA [Just 3, Nothing, Just 1]
Nothing
ghci&gt; sequenceA [(+3),(+2),(+1)] 3
[6,5,4]
ghci&gt; sequenceA [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
[[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[2,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]]
ghci&gt; sequenceA [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[3,4,4],[]]
[]</code></pre>
<p>Ah! Pretty cool. When used on <code>Maybe</code> values,
<code>sequenceA</code> creates a <code>Maybe</code> value with all the
results inside it as a list. If one of the values was
<code>Nothing</code>, then the result is also a <code>Nothing</code>.
This is cool when you have a list of <code>Maybe</code> values and
you’re interested in the values only if none of them is a
<code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>When used with functions, <code>sequenceA</code> takes a list of
functions and returns a function that returns a list. In our example, we
made a function that took a number as a parameter and applied it to each
function in the list and then returned a list of results.
<code>sequenceA [(+3),(+2),(+1)] 3</code> will call <code>(+3)</code>
with <code>3</code>, <code>(+2)</code> with <code>3</code> and
<code>(+1)</code> with <code>3</code> and present all those results as a
list.</p>
<p>Doing <code>(+) &lt;$&gt; (+3) &lt;*&gt; (*2)</code> will create a
function that takes a parameter, feeds it to both <code>(+3)</code> and
<code>(*2)</code> and then calls <code>+</code> with those two results.
In the same vein, it makes sense that <code>sequenceA [(+3),(*2)]</code>
makes a function that takes a parameter and feeds it to all of the
functions in the list. Instead of calling <code>+</code> with the
results of the functions, a combination of <code>:</code> and
<code>pure []</code> is used to gather those results in a list, which is
the result of that function.</p>
<p>Using <code>sequenceA</code> is cool when we have a list of functions
and we want to feed the same input to all of them and then view the list
of results. For instance, we have a number and we’re wondering whether
it satisfies all of the predicates in a list. One way to do that would
be like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; map (\f -&gt; f 7) [(&gt;4),(&lt;10),odd]
[True,True,True]
ghci&gt; and $ map (\f -&gt; f 7) [(&gt;4),(&lt;10),odd]
True</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <code>and</code> takes a list of booleans and returns
<code>True</code> if they’re all <code>True</code>. Another way to
achieve the same thing would be with <code>sequenceA</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; sequenceA [(&gt;4),(&lt;10),odd] 7
[True,True,True]
ghci&gt; and $ sequenceA [(&gt;4),(&lt;10),odd] 7
True</code></pre>
<p><code>sequenceA [(&gt;4),(&lt;10),odd]</code> creates a function that
will take a number and feed it to all of the predicates in
<code>[(&gt;4),(&lt;10),odd]</code> and return a list of booleans. It
turns a list with the type <code>(Num a) =&gt; [a -&gt; Bool]</code>
into a function with the type <code>(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; [Bool]</code>.
Pretty neat, huh?</p>
<p>Because lists are homogenous, all the functions in the list have to
be functions of the same type, of course. You can’t have a list like
<code>[ord, (+3)]</code>, because <code>ord</code> takes a character and
returns a number, whereas <code>(+3)</code> takes a number and returns a
number.</p>
<p>When used with <code>[]</code>, <code>sequenceA</code> takes a list
of lists and returns a list of lists. Hmm, interesting. It actually
creates lists that have all possible combinations of their elements. For
illustration, here’s the above done with <code>sequenceA</code> and then
done with a list comprehension:</p>

<p>This might be a bit hard to grasp, but if you play with it for a
while, you’ll see how it works. Let’s say that we’re doing
<code>sequenceA [[1,2],[3,4]]</code>. To see how this happens, let’s use
the
<code>sequenceA (x:xs) = (:) &lt;$&gt; x &lt;*&gt; sequenceA xs</code>
definition of <code>sequenceA</code> and the edge condition
<code>sequenceA [] = pure []</code>. You don’t have to follow this
evaluation, but it might help you if have trouble imagining how
<code>sequenceA</code> works on lists of lists, because it can be a bit
mind-bending.</p>
<ul>
<li>We start off with <code>sequenceA [[1,2],[3,4]]</code></li>
<li>That evaluates to
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; sequenceA [[3,4]]</code></li>
<li>Evaluating the inner <code>sequenceA</code> further, we get
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; ((:) &lt;$&gt; [3,4] &lt;*&gt; sequenceA [])</code></li>
<li>We’ve reached the edge condition, so this is now
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; ((:) &lt;$&gt; [3,4] &lt;*&gt; [[]])</code></li>
<li>Now, we evaluate the <code>(:) &lt;$&gt; [3,4] &lt;*&gt; [[]]</code>
part, which will use <code>:</code> with every possible value in the
left list (possible values are <code>3</code> and <code>4</code>) with
every possible value on the right list (only possible value is
<code>[]</code>), which results in <code>[3:[], 4:[]]</code>, which is
<code>[[3],[4]]</code>. So now we have
<code>(:) &lt;$&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; [[3],[4]]</code></li>
<li>Now, <code>:</code> is used with every possible value from the left
list (<code>1</code> and <code>2</code>) with every possible value in
the right list (<code>[3]</code> and <code>[4]</code>), which results in
<code>[1:[3], 1:[4], 2:[3], 2:[4]]</code>, which is
<code>[[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Doing <code>(+) &lt;$&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; [4,5,6]</code>results in a
non-deterministic computation <code>x + y</code> where <code>x</code>
takes on every value from <code>[1,2]</code> and <code>y</code> takes on
every value from <code>[4,5,6]</code>. We represent that as a list which
holds all of the possible results. Similarly, when we do
<code>sequence [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]</code>, the result is a
non-deterministic computation <code>[x,y,z,w]</code>, where
<code>x</code> takes on every value from <code>[1,2]</code>,
<code>y</code> takes on every value from <code>[3,4]</code> and so on.
To represent the result of that non-deterministic computation, we use a
list, where each element in the list is one possible list. That’s why
the result is a list of lists.</p>
<p>When used with I/O actions, <code>sequenceA</code> is the same thing
as <code>sequence</code>! It takes a list of I/O actions and returns an
I/O action that will perform each of those actions and have as its
result a list of the results of those I/O actions. That’s because to
turn an <code>[IO a]</code> value into an <code>IO [a]</code> value, to
make an I/O action that yields a list of results when performed, all
those I/O actions have to be sequenced so that they’re then performed
one after the other when evaluation is forced. You can’t get the result
of an I/O action without performing it.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; sequenceA [getLine, getLine, getLine]
heyh

woo
[&quot;heyh&quot;,&quot;ho&quot;,&quot;woo&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Like normal functors, applicative functors come with a few laws. The
most important one is the one that we already mentioned, namely that
<code class="label law">pure f &lt;*&gt; x = fmap f x</code> holds. As
an exercise, you can prove this law for some of the applicative functors
that we’ve met in this chapter.The other functor laws are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="label law">pure id &lt;*&gt; v = v</code></li>
<li><code
class="label law">pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w)</code></li>
<li><code
class="label law">pure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = pure (f x)</code></li>
<li><code
class="label law">u &lt;*&gt; pure y = pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We won’t go over them in detail right now because that would take up
a lot of pages and it would probably be kind of boring, but if you’re up
to the task, you can take a closer look at them and see if they hold for
some of the instances.</p>
<p>In conclusion, applicative functors aren’t just interesting, they’re
also useful, because they allow us to combine different computations,
such as I/O computations, non-deterministic computations, computations
that might have failed, etc. by using the applicative style. Just by
using <code>&lt;$&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;*&gt;</code> we can use
normal functions to uniformly operate on any number of applicative
functors and take advantage of the semantics of each one.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve learned how to make our own algebraic data types by
using the <strong>data</strong> keyword. We’ve also learned how to give
existing types synonyms with the <strong>type</strong> keyword. In this
section, we’ll be taking a look at how to make new types out of existing
data types by using the <strong>newtype</strong> keyword and why we’d
want to do that in the first place.</p>
<p>In the previous section, we saw that there are actually more ways for
the list type to be an applicative functor. One way is to have
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> take every function out of the list that is its
left parameter and apply it to every value in the list that is on the
right, resulting in every possible combination of applying a function
from the left list to a value in the right list.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [(+1),(*100),(*5)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2,3]
[2,3,4,100,200,300,5,10,15]</code></pre>
<p>The second way is to take the first function on the left side of
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> and apply it to the first value on the right,
then take the second function from the list on the left side and apply
it to the second value on the right, and so on. Ultimately, it’s kind of
like zipping the two lists together. But lists are already an instance
of <code>Applicative</code>, so how did we also make lists an instance
of <code>Applicative</code> in this second way? If you remember, we said
that the <code>ZipList a</code> type was introduced for this reason,
which has one value constructor, <code>ZipList</code>, that has just one
field. We put the list that we’re wrapping in that field. Then,
<code>ZipList</code> was made an instance of <code>Applicative</code>,
so that when we want to use lists as applicatives in the zipping manner,
we just wrap them with the <code>ZipList</code> constructor and then
once we’re done, unwrap them with <code>getZipList</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getZipList $ ZipList [(+1),(*100),(*5)] &lt;*&gt; ZipList [1,2,3]
[2,200,15]</code></pre>
<p>So, what does this have to do with this <em>newtype</em> keyword?
Well, think about how we might write the data declaration for our
<code>ZipList a</code> type. One way would be to do it like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data ZipList a = ZipList [a]</code></pre>
<p>A type that has just one value constructor and that value constructor
has just one field that is a list of things. We might also want to use
record syntax so that we automatically get a function that extracts a
list from a <code>ZipList</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [a] }</code></pre>
<p>This looks fine and would actually work pretty well. We had two ways
of making an existing type an instance of a type class, so we used the
<em>data</em> keyword to just wrap that type into another type and made
the other type an instance in the second way.</p>
<p>The <em>newtype</em> keyword in Haskell is made exactly for these
cases when we want to just take one type and wrap it in something to
present it as another type. In the actual libraries,
<code>ZipList a</code> is defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype ZipList a = ZipList { getZipList :: [a] }</code></pre>
<p>Instead of the <em>data</em> keyword, the <em>newtype</em> keyword is
used. Now why is that? Well for one, <em>newtype</em> is faster. If you
use the <em>data</em> keyword to wrap a type, there’s some overhead to
all that wrapping and unwrapping when your program is running. But if
you use <em>newtype</em>, Haskell knows that you’re just using it to
wrap an existing type into a new type (hence the name), because you want
it to be the same internally but have a different type. With that in
mind, Haskell can get rid of the wrapping and unwrapping once it
resolves which value is of what type.</p>
<p>So why not just use <em>newtype</em> all the time instead of
<em>data</em> then? Well, when you make a new type from an existing type
by using the <em>newtype</em> keyword, you can only have one value
constructor and that value constructor can only have one field. But with
<em>data</em>, you can make data types that have several value
constructors and each constructor can have zero or more fields:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Profession = Fighter | Archer | Accountant

data Race = Human | Elf | Orc | Goblin

data PlayerCharacter = PlayerCharacter Race Profession</code></pre>
<p>When using <em>newtype</em>, you’re restricted to just one
constructor with one field.</p>
<p>We can also use the <em>deriving</em> keyword with <em>newtype</em>
just like we would with <em>data</em>. We can derive instances for
<code>Eq</code>, <code>Ord</code>, <code>Enum</code>,
<code>Bounded</code>, <code>Show</code> and <code>Read</code>. If we
derive the instance for a type class, the type that we’re wrapping has
to be in that type class to begin with. It makes sense, because
<em>newtype</em> just wraps an existing type. So now if we do the
following, we can print and equate values of our new type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype CharList = CharList { getCharList :: [Char] } deriving (Eq, Show)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s give that a go:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; CharList &quot;this will be shown!&quot;
CharList {getCharList = &quot;this will be shown!&quot;}
ghci&gt; CharList &quot;benny&quot; == CharList &quot;benny&quot;
True
ghci&gt; CharList &quot;benny&quot; == CharList &quot;oisters&quot;
False</code></pre>
<p>In this particular <em>newtype</em>, the value constructor has the
following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>CharList :: [Char] -&gt; CharList</code></pre>
<p>It takes a <code>[Char]</code> value, such as
<code>"my sharona"</code> and returns a <code>CharList</code> value.
From the above examples where we used the <code>CharList</code> value
constructor, we see that really is the case. Conversely, the
<code>getCharList</code> function, which was generated for us because we
used record syntax in our <em>newtype</em>, has this type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>getCharList :: CharList -&gt; [Char]</code></pre>
<p>It takes a <code>CharList</code> value and converts it to a
<code>[Char]</code> value. You can think of this as wrapping and
unwrapping, but you can also think of it as converting values from one
type to the other.</p>
<h3 id="using-newtype-to-make-type-class-instances">Using newtype to
make type class instances</h3>
<p>Many times, we want to make our types instances of certain type
classes, but the type parameters just don’t match up for what we want to
do. It’s easy to make <code>Maybe</code> an instance of
<code>Functor</code>, because the <code>Functor</code> type class is
defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>So we just start out with:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor Maybe where</code></pre>
<p>And then implement <code>fmap</code>. All the type parameters add up
because the <code>Maybe</code> takes the place of <code>f</code> in the
definition of the <code>Functor</code> type class and so if we look at
<code>fmap</code> like it only worked on <code>Maybe</code>, it ends up
behaving like:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/krakatoa.png"
class="right" width="322" height="280" alt="wow, very evil" /></p>
<p>Isn’t that just peachy? Now what if we wanted to make the tuple an
instance of <code>Functor</code> in such a way that when we
<code>fmap</code> a function over a tuple, it gets applied to the first
component of the tuple? That way, doing <code>fmap (+3) (1,1)</code>
would result in <code>(4,1)</code>. It turns out that writing the
instance for that is kind of hard. With <code>Maybe</code>, we just say
<code>instance Functor Maybe where</code> because only type constructors
that take exactly one parameter can be made an instance of
<code>Functor</code>. But it seems like there’s no way to do something
like that with <code>(a,b)</code> so that the type parameter
<code>a</code> ends up being the one that changes when we use
<code>fmap</code>. To get around this, we can <em>newtype</em> our tuple
in such a way that the second type parameter represents the type of the
first component in the tuple:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype Pair b a = Pair { getPair :: (a,b) }</code></pre>
<p>And now, we can make it an instance of <code>Functor</code> so that
the function is mapped over the first component:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor (Pair c) where
    fmap f (Pair (x,y)) = Pair (f x, y)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can pattern match on types defined with
<em>newtype</em>. We pattern match to get the underlying tuple, then we
apply the function <code>f</code> to the first component in the tuple
and then we use the <code>Pair</code> value constructor to convert the
tuple back to our <code>Pair b a</code>. If we imagine what the type
<code>fmap</code> would be if it only worked on our new pairs, it would
be:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Pair c a -&gt; Pair c b</code></pre>
<p>Again, we said <code>instance Functor (Pair c) where</code> and so
<code>Pair c</code> took the place of the <code>f</code> in the type
class definition for <code>Functor</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>So now, if we convert a tuple into a <code>Pair b a</code>, we can
use <code>fmap</code> over it and the function will be mapped over the
first component:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getPair $ fmap (*100) (Pair (2,3))
(200,3)
ghci&gt; getPair $ fmap reverse (Pair (&quot;london calling&quot;, 3))
(&quot;gnillac nodnol&quot;,3)</code></pre>
<h3 id="on-newtype-laziness">On newtype laziness</h3>
<p>We mentioned that <em>newtype</em> is usually faster than
<em>data</em>. The only thing that can be done with <em>newtype</em> is
turning an existing type into a new type, so internally, Haskell can
represent the values of types defined with <em>newtype</em> just like
the original ones, only it has to keep in mind that their types are now
distinct. This fact means that not only is <em>newtype</em> faster, it’s
also lazier. Let’s take a look at what this means.</p>
<p>Like we’ve said before, Haskell is lazy by default, which means that
only when we try to actually print the results of our functions will any
computation take place. Furthermore, only those computations that are
necessary for our function to tell us the result will get carried out.
The <code>undefined</code> value in Haskell represents an erroneous
computation. If we try to evaluate it (that is, force Haskell to
actually compute it) by printing it to the terminal, Haskell will throw
a hissy fit (technically referred to as an exception):</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; undefined
*** Exception: Prelude.undefined</code></pre>
<p>However, if we make a list that has some <code>undefined</code>
values in it but request only the head of the list, which is not
<code>undefined</code>, everything will go smoothly because Haskell
doesn’t really need to evaluate any other elements in a list if we only
want to see what the first element is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; head [3,4,5,undefined,2,undefined]
3</code></pre>
<p>Now consider the following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data CoolBool = CoolBool { getCoolBool :: Bool }</code></pre>
<p>It’s your run-of-the-mill algebraic data type that was defined with
the <em>data</em> keyword. It has one value constructor, which has one
field whose type is <code>Bool</code>. Let’s make a function that
pattern matches on a <code>CoolBool</code> and returns the value
<code>"hello"</code> regardless of whether the <code>Bool</code> inside
the <code>CoolBool</code> was <code>True</code> or
<code>False</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>helloMe :: CoolBool -&gt; String
helloMe (CoolBool _) = &quot;hello&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Instead of applying this function to a normal <code>CoolBool</code>,
let’s throw it a curveball and apply it to <code>undefined</code>!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; helloMe undefined
&quot;*** Exception: Prelude.undefined</code></pre>
<p>Yikes! An exception! Now why did this exception happen? Types defined
with the <em>data</em> keyword can have multiple value constructors
(even though <code>CoolBool</code> only has one). So in order to see if
the value given to our function conforms to the
<code>(CoolBool _)</code> pattern, Haskell has to evaluate the value
just enough to see which value constructor was used when we made the
value. And when we try to evaluate an <code>undefined</code> value, even
a little, an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>Instead of using the <em>data</em> keyword for <code>CoolBool</code>,
let’s try using <em>newtype</em>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype CoolBool = CoolBool { getCoolBool :: Bool }</code></pre>
<p>We don’t have to change our <code>helloMe</code> function, because
the pattern matching syntax is the same if you use <em>newtype</em> or
<em>data</em> to define your type. Let’s do the same thing here and
apply <code>helloMe</code> to an <code>undefined</code> value:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; helloMe undefined
&quot;hello&quot;</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/shamrock.png"
class="right" width="184" height="230"
alt="top of the mornin to ya!!!" /></p>
<p>It worked! Hmmm, why is that? Well, like we’ve said, when we use
<em>newtype</em>, Haskell can internally represent the values of the new
type in the same way as the original values. It doesn’t have to add
another box around them, it just has to be aware of the values being of
different types. And because Haskell knows that types made with the
<em>newtype</em> keyword can only have one constructor, it doesn’t have
to evaluate the value passed to the function to make sure that it
conforms to the <code>(CoolBool _)</code> pattern because
<em>newtype</em> types can only have one possible value constructor and
one field!</p>
<p>This difference in behavior may seem trivial, but it’s actually
pretty important because it helps us realize that even though types
defined with <em>data</em> and <em>newtype</em> behave similarly from
the programmer’s point of view because they both have value constructors
and fields, they are actually two different mechanisms. Whereas
<em>data</em> can be used to make your own types from scratch,
<em>newtype</em> is for making a completely new type out of an existing
type. Pattern matching on <em>newtype</em> values isn’t like taking
something out of a box (like it is with <em>data</em>), it’s more about
making a direct conversion from one type to another.</p>
<h3 id="type-vs.-newtype-vs.-data"><code>type</code>
vs. <code>newtype</code> vs. <code>data</code></h3>
<p>At this point, you may be a bit confused about what exactly the
difference between <em>type</em>, <em>data</em> and <em>newtype</em> is,
so let’s refresh our memory a bit.</p>
<p>The <strong>type</strong> keyword is for making type synonyms. What
that means is that we just give another name to an already existing type
so that the type is easier to refer to. Say we did the following:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type IntList = [Int]</code></pre>
<p>All this does is to allow us to refer to the <code>[Int]</code> type
as <code>IntList</code>. They can be used interchangeably. We don’t get
an <code>IntList</code> value constructor or anything like that. Because
<code>[Int]</code> and <code>IntList</code> are only two ways to refer
to the same type, it doesn’t matter which name we use in our type
annotations:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; ([1,2,3] :: IntList) ++ ([1,2,3] :: [Int])
[1,2,3,1,2,3]</code></pre>
<p>We use type synonyms when we want to make our type signatures more
descriptive by giving types names that tell us something about their
purpose in the context of the functions where they’re being used. For
instance, when we used an association list of type
<code>[(String,String)]</code> to represent a phone book, we gave it the
type synonym of <code>PhoneBook</code> so that the type signatures of
our functions were easier to read.</p>
<p>The <strong>newtype</strong> keyword is for taking existing types and
wrapping them in new types, mostly so that it’s easier to make them
instances of certain type classes. When we use <em>newtype</em> to wrap
an existing type, the type that we get is separate from the original
type. If we make the following <em>newtype</em>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype CharList = CharList { getCharList :: [Char] }</code></pre>
<p>We can’t use <code>++</code> to put together a <code>CharList</code>
and a list of type <code>[Char]</code>. We can’t even use
<code>++</code> to put together two <code>CharList</code>s, because
<code>++</code> works only on lists and the <code>CharList</code> type
isn’t a list, even though it could be said that it contains one. We can,
however, convert two <code>CharList</code>s to lists, <code>++</code>
them and then convert that back to a <code>CharList</code>.</p>
<p>When we use record syntax in our <em>newtype</em> declarations, we
get functions for converting between the new type and the original type:
namely the value constructor of our <em>newtype</em> and the function
for extracting the value in its field. The new type also isn’t
automatically made an instance of the type classes that the original
type belongs to, so we have to derive or manually write them.</p>
<p>In practice, you can think of <em>newtype</em> declarations as
<em>data</em> declarations that can only have one constructor and one
field. If you catch yourself writing such a <em>data</em> declaration,
consider using <em>newtype</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong>data</strong> keyword is for making your own data types
and with them, you can go hog wild. They can have as many constructors
and fields as you wish and can be used to implement any algebraic data
type by yourself. Everything from lists and <code>Maybe</code>-like
types to trees.</p>
<p>If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and be more
descriptive, you probably want type synonyms. If you want to take an
existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make it an instance
of a type class, chances are you’re looking for a <em>newtype</em>. And
if you want to make something completely new, odds are good that you’re
looking for the <em>data</em> keyword.</p>
<h2 id="monoids">Monoids</h2>
<p><img

class="right" width="460" height="417"
alt="wow this is pretty much the gayest pirate ship ever" /></p>
<p>Type classes in Haskell are used to present an interface for types
that have some behavior in common. We started out with simple type
classes like <code>Eq</code>, which is for types whose values can be
equated, and <code>Ord</code>, which is for things that can be put in an
order and then moved on to more interesting ones, like
<code>Functor</code> and <code>Applicative</code>.</p>
<p>When we make a type, we think about which behaviors it supports,
i.e. what it can act like and then based on that we decide which type
classes to make it an instance of. If it makes sense for values of our
type to be equated, we make it an instance of the <code>Eq</code> type
class. If we see that our type is some kind of functor, we make it an
instance of <code>Functor</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Now consider the following: <code>*</code> is a function that takes
two numbers and multiplies them. If we multiply some number with a
<code>1</code>, the result is always equal to that number. It doesn’t
matter if we do <code>1 * x</code> or <code>x * 1</code>, the result is
always <code>x</code>. Similarly, <code>++</code> is also a function
which takes two things and returns a third. Only instead of multiplying
numbers, it takes two lists and concatenates them. And much like
<code>*</code>, it also has a certain value which doesn’t change the
other one when used with <code>++</code>. That value is the empty list:
<code>[]</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 4 * 1
4
ghci&gt; 1 * 9
9
ghci&gt; [1,2,3] ++ []
[1,2,3]
ghci&gt; [] ++ [0.5, 2.5]
[0.5,2.5]</code></pre>
<p>It seems that both <code>*</code> together with <code>1</code> and
<code>++</code> along with <code>[]</code> share some common
properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function takes two parameters.</li>
<li>The parameters and the returned value have the same type.</li>
<li>There exists such a value that doesn’t change other values when used
with the binary function.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s another thing that these two operations have in common that
may not be as obvious as our previous observations: when we have three
or more values and we want to use the binary function to reduce them to
a single result, the order in which we apply the binary function to the
values doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if we do
<code>(3 * 4) * 5</code> or <code>3 * (4 * 5)</code>. Either way, the
result is <code>60</code>. The same goes for <code>++</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (3 * 2) * (8 * 5)
240
ghci&gt; 3 * (2 * (8 * 5))
240
ghci&gt; &quot;la&quot; ++ (&quot;di&quot; ++ &quot;da&quot;)
&quot;ladida&quot;
ghci&gt; (&quot;la&quot; ++ &quot;di&quot;) ++ &quot;da&quot;
&quot;ladida&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We call this property <em>associativity</em>. <code>*</code> is
associative, and so is <code>++</code>, but <code>-</code>, for example,
is not. The expressions <code>(5 - 3) - 4</code> and
<code>5 - (3 - 4)</code> result in different numbers.</p>
<p>By noticing and writing down these properties, we have chanced upon
<em>monoids</em>! A monoid is when you have an associative binary
function and a value which acts as an identity with respect to that
function. When something acts as an identity with respect to a function,
it means that when called with that function and some other value, the
result is always equal to that other value. <code>1</code> is the
identity with respect to <code>*</code> and <code>[]</code> is the
identity with respect to <code>++</code>. There are a lot of other
monoids to be found in the world of Haskell, which is why the
<code>Monoid</code> type class exists. It’s for types which can act like
monoids. Let’s see how the type class is defined:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Monoid m where
    mempty :: m
    mappend :: m -&gt; m -&gt; m
    mconcat :: [m] -&gt; m
    mconcat = foldr mappend mempty</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/balloondog.png"
class="right" width="260" height="326" alt="woof dee do!!!" /></p>
<p>The <code>Monoid</code> type class is defined in
<code>import Data.Monoid</code>. Let’s take some time and get properly
acquainted with it.</p>
<p>First of all, we see that only concrete types can be made instances
of <code>Monoid</code>, because the <code>m</code> in the type class
definition doesn’t take any type parameters. This is different from
<code>Functor</code> and <code>Applicative</code>, which require their
instances to be type constructors which take one parameter.</p>
<p>The first function is <code>mempty</code>. It’s not really a
function, since it doesn’t take parameters, so it’s a polymorphic
constant, kind of like <code>minBound</code> from <code>Bounded</code>.
<code>mempty</code> represents the identity value for a particular
monoid.</p>
<p>Next up, we have <code>mappend</code>, which, as you’ve probably
guessed, is the binary function. It takes two values of the same type
and returns a value of that type as well. It’s worth noting that the
decision to name <code>mappend</code> as it’s named was kind of
unfortunate, because it implies that we’re appending two things in some
way. While <code>++</code> does take two lists and append one to the
other, <code>*</code> doesn’t really do any appending, it just
multiplies two numbers together. When we meet other instances of
<code>Monoid</code>, we’ll see that most of them don’t append values
either, so avoid thinking in terms of appending and just think in terms
of <code>mappend</code> being a binary function that takes two monoid
values and returns a third.</p>
<p>The last function in this type class definition is
<code>mconcat</code>. It takes a list of monoid values and reduces them
to a single value by doing <code>mappend</code> between the list’s
elements. It has a default implementation, which just takes
<code>mempty</code> as a starting value and folds the list from the
right with <code>mappend</code>. Because the default implementation is
fine for most instances, we won’t concern ourselves with
<code>mconcat</code> too much from now on. When making a type an
instance of <code>Monoid</code>, it suffices to just implement
<code>mempty</code> and <code>mappend</code>. The reason
<code>mconcat</code> is there at all is because for some instances,
there might be a more efficient way to implement <code>mconcat</code>,
but for most instances the default implementation is just fine.</p>
<p>Before moving on to specific instances of <code>Monoid</code>, let’s
take a brief look at the monoid laws. We mentioned that there has to be
a value that acts as the identity with respect to the binary function
and that the binary function has to be associative. It’s possible to
make instances of <code>Monoid</code> that don’t follow these rules, but
such instances are of no use to anyone because when using the
<code>Monoid</code> type class, we rely on its instances acting like
monoids. Otherwise, what’s the point? That’s why when making instances,
we have to make sure they follow these laws:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="label law">mempty `mappend` x = x</code></li>
<li><code class="label law">x `mappend` mempty = x</code></li>
<li><code
class="label law">(x `mappend` y) `mappend` z = x `mappend` (y `mappend` z)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first two state that <code>mempty</code> has to act as the
identity with respect to <code>mappend</code> and the third says that
<code>mappend</code> has to be associative i.e. that it the order in
which we use <code>mappend</code> to reduce several monoid values into
one doesn’t matter. Haskell doesn’t enforce these laws, so we as the
programmer have to be careful that our instances do indeed obey
them.</p>
<h3 id="lists-are-monoids">Lists are monoids</h3>
<p>Yes, lists are monoids! Like we’ve seen, the <code>++</code> function
and the empty list <code>[]</code> form a monoid. The instance is very
simple:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid [a] where
    mempty = []
    mappend = (++)</code></pre>
<p>Lists are an instance of the <code>Monoid</code> type class
regardless of the type of the elements they hold. Notice that we wrote
<code>instance Monoid [a]</code> and not
<code>instance Monoid []</code>, because <code>Monoid</code> requires a
concrete type for an instance.</p>
<p>Giving this a test run, we encounter no surprises:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [1,2,3] `mappend` [4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
ghci&gt; (&quot;one&quot; `mappend` &quot;two&quot;) `mappend` &quot;tree&quot;
&quot;onetwotree&quot;
ghci&gt; &quot;one&quot; `mappend` (&quot;two&quot; `mappend` &quot;tree&quot;)
&quot;onetwotree&quot;
ghci&gt; &quot;one&quot; `mappend` &quot;two&quot; `mappend` &quot;tree&quot;
&quot;onetwotree&quot;
ghci&gt; &quot;pang&quot; `mappend` mempty
&quot;pang&quot;
ghci&gt; mconcat [[1,2],[3,6],[9]]
[1,2,3,6,9]
ghci&gt; mempty :: [a]
[]</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/smug.png"
class="left" width="157" height="144" alt="smug as hell" /></p>
<p>Notice that in the last line, we had to write an explicit type
annotation, because if we just did <code>mempty</code>, GHCi wouldn’t
know which instance to use, so we had to say we want the list instance.
We were able to use the general type of <code>[a]</code> (as opposed to
specifying <code>[Int]</code> or <code>[String]</code>) because the
empty list can act as if it contains any type.</p>
<p>Because <code>mconcat</code> has a default implementation, we get it
for free when we make something an instance of <code>Monoid</code>. In
the case of the list, <code>mconcat</code> turns out to be just
<code>concat</code>. It takes a list of lists and flattens it, because
that’s the equivalent of doing <code>++</code> between all the adjecent
lists in a list.</p>
<p>The monoid laws do indeed hold for the list instance. When we have
several lists and we <code>mappend</code> (or <code>++</code>) them
together, it doesn’t matter which ones we do first, because they’re just
joined at the ends anyway. Also, the empty list acts as the identity so
all is well. Notice that monoids don’t require that
<code>a `mappend` b</code> be equal to <code>b `mappend` a</code>. In
the case of the list, they clearly aren’t:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; &quot;one&quot; `mappend` &quot;two&quot;
&quot;onetwo&quot;
ghci&gt; &quot;two&quot; `mappend` &quot;one&quot;
&quot;twoone&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And that’s okay. The fact that for multiplication <code>3 * 5</code>
and <code>5 * 3</code> are the same is just a property of
multiplication, but it doesn’t hold for all (and indeed, most)
monoids.</p>
<h3 id="product-and-sum"><code>Product</code> and <code>Sum</code></h3>
<p>We already examined one way for numbers to be considered monoids.
Just have the binary function be <code>*</code> and the identity value
<code>1</code>. It turns out that that’s not the only way for numbers to
be monoids. Another way is to have the binary function be <code>+</code>
and the identity value <code>0</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 0 + 4
4
ghci&gt; 5 + 0
5
ghci&gt; (1 + 3) + 5
9
ghci&gt; 1 + (3 + 5)
9</code></pre>
<p>The monoid laws hold, because if you add 0 to any number, the result
is that number. And addition is also associative, so we get no problems
there. So now that there are two equally valid ways for numbers to be
monoids, which way do choose? Well, we don’t have to. Remember, when
there are several ways for some type to be an instance of the same type
class, we can wrap that type in a <em>newtype</em> and then make the new
type an instance of the type class in a different way. We can have our
cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>The <code>Data.Monoid</code> module exports two types for this,
namely <code>Product</code> and <code>Sum</code>. <code>Product</code>
is defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype Product a =  Product { getProduct :: a }
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show, Bounded)</code></pre>
<p>Simple, just a <em>newtype</em> wrapper with one type parameter along
with some derived instances. Its instance for <code>Monoid</code> goes a
little something like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Num a =&gt; Monoid (Product a) where
    mempty = Product 1
    Product x `mappend` Product y = Product (x * y)</code></pre>
<p><code>mempty</code> is just <code>1</code> wrapped in a
<code>Product</code> constructor. <code>mappend</code> pattern matches
on the <code>Product</code> constructor, multiplies the two numbers and
then wraps the resulting number back. As you can see, there’s a
<code>Num a</code> class constraint. So this means that
<code>Product a</code> is an instance of <code>Monoid</code> for all
<code>a</code>’s that are already an instance of <code>Num</code>. To
use <code>Producta a</code> as a monoid, we have to do some
<em>newtype</em> wrapping and unwrapping:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getProduct $ Product 3 `mappend` Product 9
27
ghci&gt; getProduct $ Product 3 `mappend` mempty
3
ghci&gt; getProduct $ Product 3 `mappend` Product 4 `mappend` Product 2
24
ghci&gt; getProduct . mconcat . map Product $ [3,4,2]
24</code></pre>
<p>This is nice as a showcase of the <code>Monoid</code> type class, but
no one in their right mind would use this way of multiplying numbers
instead of just writing <code>3 * 9</code> and <code>3 * 1</code>. But a
bit later, we’ll see how these <code>Monoid</code> instances that may
seem trivial at this time can come in handy.</p>
<p><code>Sum</code> is defined like <code>Product</code> and the
instance is similar as well. We use it in the same way:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getSum $ Sum 2 `mappend` Sum 9
11
ghci&gt; getSum $ mempty `mappend` Sum 3
3
ghci&gt; getSum . mconcat . map Sum $ [1,2,3]
6</code></pre>
<h3 id="any-and-all"><code>Any</code> and <code>All</code></h3>
<p>Another type which can act like a monoid in two distinct but equally
valid ways is <code>Bool</code>. The first way is to have the
<em>or</em> function <code>||</code> act as the binary function along
with <code>False</code> as the identity value. The way <em>or</em> works
in logic is that if any of its two parameters is <code>True</code>, it
returns <code>True</code>, otherwise it returns <code>False</code>. So
if we use <code>False</code> as the identity value, it will return
<code>False</code> when <em>or</em>-ed with <code>False</code> and
<code>True</code> when <em>or</em>-ed with <code>True</code>. The
<code>Any</code> <em>newtype</em> constructor is an instance of
<code>Monoid</code> in this fashion. It’s defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype Any = Any { getAny :: Bool }
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show, Bounded)</code></pre>
<p>Its instance looks goes like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid Any where
        mempty = Any False
        Any x `mappend` Any y = Any (x || y)</code></pre>
<p>The reason it’s called <code>Any</code> is because
<code>x `mappend` y</code> will be <code>True</code> if <em>any</em> one
of those two is <code>True</code>. Even if three or more
<code>Any</code> wrapped <code>Bool</code>s are <code>mappend</code>ed
together, the result will hold <code>True</code> if any of them are
<code>True</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getAny $ Any True `mappend` Any False
True
ghci&gt; getAny $ mempty `mappend` Any True
True
ghci&gt; getAny . mconcat . map Any $ [False, False, False, True]
True
ghci&gt; getAny $ mempty `mappend` mempty
False</code></pre>
<p>The other way for <code>Bool</code> to be an instance of
<code>Monoid</code> is to kind of do the opposite: have
<code>&amp;&amp;</code> be the binary function and then make
<code>True</code> the identity value. Logical <em>and</em> will return
<code>True</code> only if both of its parameters are <code>True</code>.
This is the <em>newtype</em> declaration, nothing fancy:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype All = All { getAll :: Bool }
        deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show, Bounded)</code></pre>
<p>And this is the instance:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid All where
        mempty = All True
        All x `mappend` All y = All (x &amp;&amp; y)</code></pre>
<p>When we <code>mappend</code> values of the <code>All</code> type, the
result will be <code>True</code> only if <em>all</em> the values used in
the <code>mappend</code> operations are <code>True</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getAll $ mempty `mappend` All True
True
ghci&gt; getAll $ mempty `mappend` All False
False
ghci&gt; getAll . mconcat . map All $ [True, True, True]
True
ghci&gt; getAll . mconcat . map All $ [True, True, False]
False</code></pre>
<p>Just like with multiplication and addition, we usually explicitly
state the binary functions instead of wrapping them in <em>newtype</em>s
and then using <code>mappend</code> and <code>mempty</code>.
<code>mconcat</code> seems useful for <code>Any</code> and
<code>All</code>, but usually it’s easier to use the <code>or</code> and
<code>and</code> functions, which take lists of <code>Bool</code>s and
return <code>True</code> if any of them are <code>True</code> or if all
of them are <code>True</code>, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordering-monoid">The <code>Ordering</code> monoid</h3>
<p>Hey, remember the <code>Ordering</code> type? It’s used as the result
when comparing things and it can have three values: <code>LT</code>,
<code>EQ</code> and <code>GT</code>, which stand for <em>less than</em>,
<em>equal</em> and <em>greater than</em> respectively:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 1 `compare` 2
LT
ghci&gt; 2 `compare` 2
EQ
ghci&gt; 3 `compare` 2
GT</code></pre>
<p>With lists, numbers and boolean values, finding monoids was just a
matter of looking at already existing commonly used functions and seeing
if they exhibit some sort of monoid behavior. With
<code>Ordering</code>, we have to look a bit harder to recognize a
monoid, but it turns out that its <code>Monoid</code> instance is just
as intuitive as the ones we’ve met so far and also quite useful:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid Ordering where
    mempty = EQ
    LT `mappend` _ = LT
    EQ `mappend` y = y
    GT `mappend` _ = GT</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids/bear.png"
class="right" width="330" height="339"
alt="did anyone ORDER pizza?!?! I can’t BEAR these puns!" /></p>
<p>The instance is set up like this: when we <code>mappend</code> two
<code>Ordering</code> values, the one on the left is kept, unless the
value on the left is <code>EQ</code>, in which case the right one is the
result. The identity is <code>EQ</code>. At first, this may seem kind of
arbitrary, but it actually resembles the way we alphabetically compare
words. We compare the first two letters and if they differ, we can
already decide which word would go first in a dictionary. However, if
the first two letters are equal, then we move on to comparing the next
pair of letters and repeat the process.</p>
<p>For instance, if we were to alphabetically compare the words
<code>"ox"</code> and <code>"on"</code>, we’d first compare the first
two letters of each word, see that they are equal and then move on to
comparing the second letter of each word. We see that <code>'x'</code>
is alphabetically greater than <code>'n'</code>, and so we know how the
words compare. To gain some intuition for <code>EQ</code> being the
identity, we can notice that if we were to cram the same letter in the
same position in both words, it wouldn’t change their alphabetical
ordering. <code>"oix"</code> is still alphabetically greater than and
<code>"oin"</code>.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that in the <code>Monoid</code> instance for
<code>Ordering</code>, <code>x `mappend` y</code> doesn’t equal
<code>y `mappend` x</code>. Because the first parameter is kept unless
it’s <code>EQ</code>, <code>LT `mappend` GT</code> will result in
<code>LT</code>, whereas <code>GT `mappend` LT</code> will result in
<code>GT</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; LT `mappend` GT
LT
ghci&gt; GT `mappend` LT
GT
ghci&gt; mempty `mappend` LT
LT
ghci&gt; mempty `mappend` GT
GT</code></pre>
<p>OK, so how is this monoid useful? Let’s say you were writing a
function that takes two strings, compares their lengths, and returns an
<code>Ordering</code>. But if the strings are of the same length, then
instead of returning <code>EQ</code> right away, we want to compare them
alphabetically. One way to write this would be like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>lengthCompare :: String -&gt; String -&gt; Ordering
lengthCompare x y = let a = length x `compare` length y
                        b = x `compare` y
                    in  if a == EQ then b else a</code></pre>
<p>We name the result of comparing the lengths <code>a</code> and the
result of the alphabetical comparison <code>b</code> and then if it
turns out that the lengths were equal, we return their alphabetical
ordering.</p>
<p>But by employing our understanding of how <code>Ordering</code> is a
monoid, we can rewrite this function in a much simpler manner:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.Monoid

lengthCompare :: String -&gt; String -&gt; Ordering
lengthCompare x y = (length x `compare` length y) `mappend`
                    (x `compare` y)</code></pre>
<p>We can try this out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; lengthCompare &quot;zen&quot; &quot;ants&quot;
LT
ghci&gt; lengthCompare &quot;zen&quot; &quot;ant&quot;
GT</code></pre>
<p>Remember, when we use <code>mappend</code>, its left parameter is
always kept unless it’s <code>EQ</code>, in which case the right one is
kept. That’s why we put the comparison that we consider to be the first,
more important criterion as the first parameter. If we wanted to expand
this function to also compare for the number of vowels and set this to
be the second most important criterion for comparison, we’d just modify
it like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.Monoid

lengthCompare :: String -&gt; String -&gt; Ordering
lengthCompare x y = (length x `compare` length y) `mappend`
                    (vowels x `compare` vowels y) `mappend`
                    (x `compare` y)
    where vowels = length . filter (`elem` &quot;aeiou&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We made a helper function, which takes a string and tells us how many
vowels it has by first filtering it only for letters that are in the
string <code>"aeiou"</code> and then applying <code>length</code> to
that.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; lengthCompare &quot;zen&quot; &quot;anna&quot;
LT
ghci&gt; lengthCompare &quot;zen&quot; &quot;ana&quot;
LT
ghci&gt; lengthCompare &quot;zen&quot; &quot;ann&quot;
GT</code></pre>
<p>Very cool. Here, we see how in the first example the lengths are
found to be different and so <code>LT</code> is returned, because the
length of <code>"zen"</code> is less than the length of
<code>"anna"</code>. In the second example, the lengths are the same,
but the second string has more vowels, so <code>LT</code> is returned
again. In the third example, they both have the same length and the same
number of vowels, so they’re compared alphabetically and
<code>"zen"</code> wins.</p>
<p>The <code>Ordering</code> monoid is very cool because it allows us to
easily compare things by many different criteria and put those criteria
in an order themselves, ranging from the most important to the
least.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-the-monoid"><code>Maybe</code> the monoid</h3>
<p>Let’s take a look at the various ways that <code>Maybe a</code> can
be made an instance of <code>Monoid</code> and what those instances are
useful for.</p>
<p>One way is to treat <code>Maybe a</code> as a monoid only if its type
parameter <code>a</code> is a monoid as well and then implement
<code>mappend</code> in such a way that it uses the <code>mappend</code>
operation of the values that are wrapped with <code>Just</code>. We use
<code>Nothing</code> as the identity, and so if one of the two values
that we’re <code>mappend</code>ing is <code>Nothing</code>, we keep the
other value. Here’s the instance declaration:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid a =&gt; Monoid (Maybe a) where
    mempty = Nothing
    Nothing `mappend` m = m
    m `mappend` Nothing = m
    Just m1 `mappend` Just m2 = Just (m1 `mappend` m2)</code></pre>
<p>Notice the class constraint. It says that <code>Maybe a</code> is an
instance of <code>Monoid</code> only if <code>a</code> is an instance of
<code>Monoid</code>. If we <code>mappend</code> something with a
<code>Nothing</code>, the result is that something. If we
<code>mappend</code> two <code>Just</code> values, the contents of the
<code>Just</code>s get <code>mappended</code> and then wrapped back in a
<code>Just</code>. We can do this because the class constraint ensures
that the type of what’s inside the <code>Just</code> is an instance of
<code>Monoid</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Nothing `mappend` Just &quot;andy&quot;
Just &quot;andy&quot;
ghci&gt; Just LT `mappend` Nothing
Just LT
ghci&gt; Just (Sum 3) `mappend` Just (Sum 4)
Just (Sum {getSum = 7})</code></pre>
<p>This comes in use when you’re dealing with monoids as results of
computations that may have failed. Because of this instance, we don’t
have to check if the computations have failed by seeing if they’re a
<code>Nothing</code> or <code>Just</code> value; we can just continue to
treat them as normal monoids.</p>
<p>But what if the type of the contents of the <code>Maybe</code> aren’t
an instance of <code>Monoid</code>? Notice that in the previous instance
declaration, the only case where we have to rely on the contents being
monoids is when both parameters of <code>mappend</code> are
<code>Just</code> values. But if we don’t know if the contents are
monoids, we can’t use <code>mappend</code> between them, so what are we
to do? Well, one thing we can do is to just discard the second value and
keep the first one. For this, the <code>First a</code> type exists and
this is its definition:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>newtype First a = First { getFirst :: Maybe a }
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)</code></pre>
<p>We take a <code>Maybe a</code> and we wrap it with a
<em>newtype</em>. The <code>Monoid</code> instance is as follows:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monoid (First a) where
    mempty = First Nothing
    First (Just x) `mappend` _ = First (Just x)
    First Nothing `mappend` x = x</code></pre>
<p>Just like we said. <code>mempty</code> is just a <code>Nothing</code>
wrapped with the <code>First</code> <em>newtype</em> constructor. If
<code>mappend</code>’s first parameter is a <code>Just</code> value, we
ignore the second one. If the first one is a <code>Nothing</code>, then
we present the second parameter as a result, regardless of whether it’s
a <code>Just</code> or a <code>Nothing</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getFirst $ First (Just &#39;a&#39;) `mappend` First (Just &#39;b&#39;)
Just &#39;a&#39;
ghci&gt; getFirst $ First Nothing `mappend` First (Just &#39;b&#39;)
Just &#39;b&#39;
ghci&gt; getFirst $ First (Just &#39;a&#39;) `mappend` First Nothing
Just &#39;a&#39;</code></pre>
<p><code>First</code> is useful when we have a bunch of
<code>Maybe</code> values and we just want to know if any of them is a
<code>Just</code>. The <code>mconcat</code> function comes in handy:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getFirst . mconcat . map First $ [Nothing, Just 9, Just 10]
Just 9</code></pre>
<p>If we want a monoid on <code>Maybe a</code> such that the second
parameter is kept if both parameters of <code>mappend</code> are
<code>Just</code> values, <code>Data.Monoid</code> provides a the
<code>Last a</code> type, which works like <code>First a</code>, only
the last non-<code>Nothing</code> value is kept when
<code>mappend</code>ing and using <code>mconcat</code>:</p>

<h3 id="using-monoids-to-fold-data-structures">Using monoids to fold
data structures</h3>
<p>One of the more interesting ways to put monoids to work is to make
them help us define folds over various data structures. So far, we’ve
only done folds over lists, but lists aren’t the only data structure
that can be folded over. We can define folds over almost any data
structure. Trees especially lend themselves well to folding.</p>
<p>Because there are so many data structures that work nicely with
folds, the <code class="label class">Foldable</code> type class was
introduced. Much like <code>Functor</code> is for things that can be
mapped over, <code>Foldable</code> is for things that can be folded up!
It can be found in <code>Data.Foldable</code> and because it exports
functions whose names clash with the ones from the <code>Prelude</code>,
it’s best imported qualified (and served with basil):</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import qualified Foldable as F</code></pre>
<p>To save ourselves precious keystrokes, we’ve chosen to import it
qualified as <code>F</code>. Alright, so what are some of the functions
that this type class defines? Well, among them are <code>foldr</code>,
<code>foldl</code>, <code>foldr1</code> and <code>foldl1</code>. Huh?
But we already know these functions, what’s so new about this? Let’s
compare the types of <code>Foldable</code>’s <code>foldr</code> and the
<code>foldr</code> from the <code>Prelude</code> to see how they
differ:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t foldr
foldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b
ghci&gt; :t F.foldr
F.foldr :: (F.Foldable t) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; t a -&gt; b</code></pre>
<p>Ah! So whereas <code>foldr</code> takes a list and folds it up, the
<code>foldr</code> from <code>Data.Foldable</code> accepts any type that
can be folded up, not just lists! As expected, both <code>foldr</code>
functions do the same for lists:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; foldr (*) 1 [1,2,3]
6
ghci&gt; F.foldr (*) 1 [1,2,3]
6</code></pre>
<p>Okay then, what are some other data structures that support folds?
Well, there’s the <code>Maybe</code> we all know and love!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; F.foldl (+) 2 (Just 9)
11
ghci&gt; F.foldr (||) False (Just True)
True</code></pre>
<p>But folding over a <code>Maybe</code> value isn’t terribly
interesting, because when it comes to folding, it just acts like a list
with one element if it’s a <code>Just</code> value and as an empty list
if it’s <code>Nothing</code>. So let’s examine a data structure that’s a
little more complex then.</p>
<p>Remember the tree data structure from the <a
href="making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses.html#recursive-data-structures">Making
Our Own Types and Typeclasses</a> chapter? We defined it like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq)</code></pre>
<p>We said that a tree is either an empty tree that doesn’t hold any
values or it’s a node that holds one value and also two other trees.
After defining it, we made it an instance of <code>Functor</code> and
with that we gained the ability to <code>fmap</code> functions over it.
Now, we’re going to make it an instance of <code>Foldable</code> so that
we get the ability to fold it up. One way to make a type constructor an
instance of <code>Foldable</code> is to just directly implement
<code>foldr</code> for it. But another, often much easier way, is to
implement the <code>foldMap</code> function, which is also a part of the
<code>Foldable</code> type class. The <code>foldMap</code> function has
the following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foldMap :: (Monoid m, Foldable t) =&gt; (a -&gt; m) -&gt; t a -&gt; m</code></pre>
<p>Its first parameter is a function that takes a value of the type that
our foldable structure contains (denoted here with <code>a</code>) and
returns a monoid value. Its second parameter is a foldable structure
that contains values of type <code>a</code>. It maps that function over
the foldable structure, thus producing a foldable structure that
contains monoid values. Then, by doing <code>mappend</code> between
those monoid values, it joins them all into a single monoid value. This
function may sound kind of odd at the moment, but we’ll see that it’s
very easy to implement. What’s also cool is that implementing this
function is all it takes for our type to be made an instance of
<code>Foldable</code>. So if we just implement <code>foldMap</code> for
some type, we get <code>foldr</code> and <code>foldl</code> on that type
for free!</p>
<p>This is how we make <code>Tree</code> an instance of
<code>Foldable</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance F.Foldable Tree where
    foldMap f Empty = mempty
    foldMap f (Node x l r) = F.foldMap f l `mappend`
                             f x           `mappend`
                             F.foldMap f r</code></pre>
<p><img

class="right" width="366" height="280"
alt="find the visual pun or whatever" /></p>
<p>We think like this: if we are provided with a function that takes an
element of our tree and returns a monoid value, how do we reduce our
whole tree down to one single monoid value? When we were doing
<code>fmap</code> over our tree, we applied the function that we were
mapping to a node and then we recursively mapped the function over the
left subtree as well as the right one. Here, we’re tasked with not only
mapping a function, but with also joining up the results into a single
monoid value by using <code>mappend</code>. First we consider the case
of the empty tree — a sad and lonely tree that has no values or
subtrees. It doesn’t hold any value that we can give to our
monoid-making function, so we just say that if our tree is empty, the
monoid value it becomes is <code>mempty</code>.</p>
<p>The case of a non-empty node is a bit more interesting. It contains
two subtrees as well as a value. In this case, we recursively
<code>foldMap</code> the same function <code>f</code> over the left and
the right subtrees. Remember, our <code>foldMap</code> results in a
single monoid value. We also apply our function <code>f</code> to the
value in the node. Now we have three monoid values (two from our
subtrees and one from applying <code>f</code> to the value in the node)
and we just have to bang them together into a single value. For this
purpose we use <code>mappend</code>, and naturally the left subtree
comes first, then the node value and then the right subtree.</p>
<p>Notice that we didn’t have to provide the function that takes a value
and returns a monoid value. We receive that function as a parameter to
<code>foldMap</code> and all we have to decide is where to apply that
function and how to join up the resulting monoids from it.</p>
<p>Now that we have a <code>Foldable</code> instance for our tree type,
we get <code>foldr</code> and <code>foldl</code> for free! Consider this
tree:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>testTree = Node 5
            (Node 3
                (Node 1 Empty Empty)
                (Node 6 Empty Empty)
            )
            (Node 9
                (Node 8 Empty Empty)
                (Node 10 Empty Empty)
            )</code></pre>
<p>It has <code>5</code> at its root and then its left node is has
<code>3</code> with <code>1</code> on the left and <code>6</code> on the
right. The root’s right node has a <code>9</code> and then an
<code>8</code> to its left and a <code>10</code> on the far right side.
With a <code>Foldable</code> instance, we can do all of the folds that
we can do on lists:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; F.foldl (+) 0 testTree
42
ghci&gt; F.foldl (*) 1 testTree
64800</code></pre>
<p>And also, <code>foldMap</code> isn’t only useful for making new
instances of <code>Foldable</code>; it comes in handy for reducing our
structure to a single monoid value. For instance, if we want to know if
any number in our tree is equal to <code>3</code>, we can do this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getAny $ F.foldMap (\x -&gt; Any $ x == 3) testTree
True</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>\x -&gt; Any $ x == 3</code> is a function that takes a
number and returns a monoid value, namely a <code>Bool</code> wrapped in
<code>Any</code>. <code>foldMap</code> applies this function to every
element in our tree and then reduces the resulting monoids into a single
monoid with <code>mappend</code>. If we do this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; getAny $ F.foldMap (\x -&gt; Any $ x &gt; 15) testTree
False</code></pre>
<p>All of the nodes in our tree would hold the value
<code>Any False</code> after having the function in the lambda applied
to them. But to end up <code>True</code>, <code>mappend</code> for
<code>Any</code> has to have at least one <code>True</code> value as a
parameter. That’s why the final result is <code>False</code>, which
makes sense because no value in our tree is greater than
<code>15</code>.</p>
<p>We can also easily turn our tree into a list by doing a
<code>foldMap</code> with the <code>\x -&gt; [x]</code> function. By
first projecting that function onto our tree, each element becomes a
singleton list. The <code>mappend</code> action that takes place between
all those singleton list results in a single list that holds all of the
elements that are in our tree:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; F.foldMap (\x -&gt; [x]) testTree
[1,3,6,5,8,9,10]</code></pre>
<p>What’s cool is that all of these trick aren’t limited to trees, they
work on any instance of <code>Foldable</code>.</p>
