<h1 id="functionally-solving-problems">Functionally Solving
Problems</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll take a look at a few interesting problems and
how to think functionally to solve them as elegantly as possible. We
probably won’t be introducing any new concepts, we’ll just be flexing
our newly acquired Haskell muscles and practicing our coding skills.
Each section will present a different problem. First we’ll describe the
problem, then we’ll try and find out what the best (or least bad) way of
solving it is.</p>
<h2 id="reverse-polish-notation-calculator">Reverse Polish notation
calculator</h2>
<p>Usually when we write mathematical expressions in school, we write
them in an infix manner. For instance, we write
<code>10 - (4 + 3) * 2</code>. <code>+</code>, <code>*</code> and
<code>-</code> are infix operators, just like the infix functions we met
in Haskell (<code>+</code>, <code>`elem`</code>, etc.). This makes it
handy because we, as humans, can parse it easily in our minds by looking
at such an expression. The downside to it is that we have to use
parentheses to denote precedence.</p>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse
Polish notation</a> is another way of writing down mathematical
expressions. Initially it looks a bit weird, but it’s actually pretty
easy to understand and use because there’s no need for parentheses and
it’s very easy to punch into a calculator. While most modern calculators
use infix notation, some people still swear by RPN calculators. This is
what the previous infix expression looks like in RPN:
<code>10 4 3 + 2 * -</code>. How do we calculate what the result of that
is? Well, think of a stack. You go over the expression from left to
right. Every time a number is encountered, push it on to the stack. When
we encounter an operator, take the two numbers that are on top of the
stack (we also say that we <em>pop</em> them), use the operator and
those two and then push the resulting number back onto the stack. When
you reach the end of the expression, you should be left with a single
number if the expression was well-formed and that number represents the
result.</p>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/rpn.png" class="center"
width="626" height="224" alt="this expression" /></p>
<p>Let’s go over the expression <code>10 4 3 + 2 * -</code> together!
First we push <code>10</code> on to the stack and the stack is now
<code>10</code>. The next item is <code>4</code>, so we push it to the
stack as well. The stack is now <code>10, 4</code>. We do the same with
<code>3</code> and the stack is now <code>10, 4, 3</code>. And now, we
encounter an operator, namely <code>+</code>! We pop the two top numbers
from the stack (so now the stack is just <code>10</code>), add those
numbers together and push that result to the stack. The stack is now
<code>10, 7</code>. We push <code>2</code> to the stack, the stack for
now is <code>10, 7, 2</code>. We’ve encountered an operator again, so
let’s pop <code>7</code> and <code>2</code> off the stack, multiply them
and push that result to the stack. Multiplying <code>7</code> and
<code>2</code> produces a <code>14</code>, so the stack we have now is
<code>10, 14</code>. Finally, there’s a <code>-</code>. We pop
<code>10</code> and <code>14</code> from the stack, subtract
<code>14</code> from <code>10</code> and push that back. The number on
the stack is now <code>-4</code> and because there are no more numbers
or operators in our expression, that’s our result!</p>
<p>Now that we know how we’d calculate any RPN expression by hand, let’s
think about how we could make a Haskell function that takes as its
parameter a string that contains a RPN expression, like
<code>"10 4 3 + 2 * -"</code> and gives us back its result.</p>
<p>What would the type of that function be? We want it to take a string
as a parameter and produce a number as its result. So it will probably
be something like
<code>solveRPN :: (Num a) =&gt; String -&gt; a</code>.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Protip:</strong> it really helps to first think what the type
declaration of a function should be before concerning ourselves with the
implementation and then write it down. In Haskell, a function’s type
declaration tells us a whole lot about the function, due to the very
strong type system.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="assets/images/functionally-solving-problems/calculator.png"
class="left" width="220" height="190" alt="HA HA HA" /></p>
<p>Cool. When implementing a solution to a problem in Haskell, it’s also
good to think back on how you did it by hand and maybe try to see if you
can gain any insight from that. Here we see that we treated every number
or operator that was separated by a space as a single item. So it might
help us if we start by breaking a string like
<code>"10 4 3 + 2 * -"</code> into a list of items like
<code>["10","4","3","+","2","*","-"]</code>.</p>
<p>Next up, what did we do with that list of items in our head? We went
over it from left to right and kept a stack as we did that. Does the
previous sentence remind you of anything? Remember, in the section about
<a href="higher-order-functions.html#folds">folds</a>, we said that
pretty much any function where you traverse a list from left to right or
right to left one element by element and build up (accumulate) some
result (whether it’s a number, a list, a stack, whatever) can be
implemented with a fold.</p>
<p>In this case, we’re going to use a left fold, because we go over the
list from left to right. The accumulator value will be our stack and
hence, the result from the fold will also be a stack, only as we’ve
seen, it will only have one item.</p>
<p>One more thing to think about is, well, how are we going to represent
the stack? I propose we use a list. Also I propose that we keep the top
of our stack at the head of the list. That’s because adding to the head
(beginning) of a list is much faster than adding to the end of it. So if
we have a stack of, say, <code>10, 4, 3</code>, we’ll represent that as
the list <code>[3,4,10]</code>.</p>
<p>Now we have enough information to roughly sketch our function. It’s
going to take a string, like, <code>"10 4 3 + 2 * -"</code> and break it
down into a list of items by using <code>words</code> to get
<code>["10","4","3","+","2","*","-"]</code>. Next, we’ll do a left fold
over that list and end up with a stack that has a single item, so
<code>[-4]</code>. We take that single item out of the list and that’s
our final result!</p>
<p>So here’s a sketch of that function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

solveRPN :: (Num a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
solveRPN expression = head (foldl foldingFunction [] (words expression))
    where   foldingFunction stack item = ...</code></pre>
<p>We take the expression and turn it into a list of items. Then we fold
over that list of items with the folding function. Mind the
<code>[]</code>, which represents the starting accumulator. The
accumulator is our stack, so <code>[]</code> represents an empty stack,
which is what we start with. After getting the final stack with a single
item, we call <code>head</code> on that list to get the item out and
then we apply <code>read</code>.</p>
<p>So all that’s left now is to implement a folding function that will
take a stack, like <code>[4,10]</code>, and an item, like
<code>"3"</code> and return a new stack <code>[3,4,10]</code>. If the
stack is <code>[4,10]</code> and the item <code>"*"</code>, then it will
have to return <code>[40]</code>. But before that, let’s turn our
function into <a
href="higher-order-functions.html#composition">point-free style</a>
because it has a lot of parentheses that are kind of freaking me
out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

solveRPN :: (Num a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words
    where   foldingFunction stack item = ...</code></pre>
<p>Ah, there we go. Much better. So, the folding function will take a
stack and an item and return a new stack. We’ll use pattern matching to
get the top items of a stack and to pattern match against operators like
<code>"*"</code> and <code>"-"</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>solveRPN :: (Num a, Read a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words
    where   foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;*&quot; = (x * y):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;+&quot; = (x + y):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;-&quot; = (y - x):ys
            foldingFunction xs numberString = read numberString:xs</code></pre>
<p>We laid this out as four patterns. The patterns will be tried from
top to bottom. First the folding function will see if the current item
is <code>"*"</code>. If it is, then it will take a list like
<code>[3,4,9,3]</code> and call its first two elements <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> respectively. So in this case, <code>x</code> would
be <code>3</code> and <code>y</code> would be <code>4</code>.
<code>ys</code> would be <code>[9,3]</code>. It will return a list
that’s just like <code>ys</code>, only it has <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> multiplied as its head. So with this we pop the two
topmost numbers off the stack, multiply them and push the result back on
to the stack. If the item is not <code>"*"</code>, the pattern matching
will fall through and <code>"+"</code> will be checked, and so on.</p>
<p>If the item is none of the operators, then we assume it’s a string
that represents a number. If it’s a number, we just call
<code>read</code> on that string to get a number from it and return the
previous stack but with that number pushed to the top.</p>
<p>And that’s it! Also noticed that we added an extra class constraint
of <code>Read a</code> to the function declaration, because we call
<code>read</code> on our string to get the number. So this declaration
means that the result can be of any type that’s part of the
<code>Num</code> and <code>Read</code> typeclasses (like
<code>Int</code>, <code>Float</code>, etc.).</p>
<p>For the list of items <code>["2","3","+"]</code>, our function will
start folding from the left. The intial stack will be <code>[]</code>.
It will call the folding function with <code>[]</code> as the stack
(accumulator) and <code>"2"</code> as the item. Because that item is not
an operator, it will be <code>read</code> and the added to the beginning
of <code>[]</code>. So the new stack is now <code>[2]</code> and the
folding function will be called with <code>[2]</code> as the stack and
<code>["3"]</code> as the item, producing a new stack of
<code>[3,2]</code>. Then, it’s called for the third time with
<code>[3,2]</code> as the stack and <code>"+"</code> as the item. This
causes these two numbers to be popped off the stack, added together and
pushed back. The final stack is <code>[5]</code>, which is the number
that we return.</p>
<p>Let’s play around with our function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;10 4 3 + 2 * -&quot;
-4
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;2 3 +&quot;
5
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;90 34 12 33 55 66 + * - +&quot;
-3947
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;90 34 12 33 55 66 + * - + -&quot;
4037
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;90 34 12 33 55 66 + * - + -&quot;
4037
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;90 3 -&quot;
87</code></pre>
<p>Cool, it works! One nice thing about this function is that it can be
easily modified to support various other operators. They don’t even have
to be binary operators. For instance, we can make an operator
<code>"log"</code> that just pops one number off the stack and pushes
back its logarithm. We can also make ternary operators that pop three
numbers off the stack and push back a result or operators like
<code>"sum"</code> which pop off all the numbers and push back their
sum.</p>
<p>Let’s modify our function to take a few more operators. For
simplicity’s sake, we’ll change its type declaration so that it returns
a number of type <code>Float</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

solveRPN :: String -&gt; Float
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words
    where   foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;*&quot; = (x * y):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;+&quot; = (x + y):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;-&quot; = (y - x):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;/&quot; = (y / x):ys
            foldingFunction (x:y:ys) &quot;^&quot; = (y ** x):ys
            foldingFunction (x:xs) &quot;ln&quot; = log x:xs
            foldingFunction xs &quot;sum&quot; = [sum xs]
            foldingFunction xs numberString = read numberString:xs</code></pre>
<p>Wow, great! <code>/</code> is division of course and <code>**</code>
is floating point exponentiation. With the logarithm operator, we just
pattern match against a single element and the rest of the stack because
we only need one element to perform its natural logarithm. With the sum
operator, we just return a stack that has only one element, which is the
sum of the stack so far.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;2.7 ln&quot;
0.9932518
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;10 10 10 10 sum 4 /&quot;
10.0
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;10 10 10 10 10 sum 4 /&quot;
12.5
ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;10 2 ^&quot;
100.0</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we can include floating point numbers in our expression
because <code>read</code> knows how to read them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; solveRPN &quot;43.2425 0.5 ^&quot;
6.575903</code></pre>
<p>I think that making a function that can calculate arbitrary floating
point RPN expressions and has the option to be easily extended in 10
lines is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>One thing to note about this function is that it’s not really
fault-tolerant. When given input that doesn’t make sense, it will just
crash everything. We’ll make a fault-tolerant version of this with a
type declaration of <code>solveRPN :: String -&gt; Maybe Float</code>
once we get to know monads (they’re not scary, trust me!). We could make
one right now, but it would be a bit tedious because it would involve a
lot of checking for <code>Nothing</code> on every step. If you’re
feeling up to the challenge though, you can go ahead and try it! Hint:
you can use <code>reads</code> to see if a read was successful or
not.</p>
<h2 id="heathrow-to-london">Heathrow to London</h2>
<p>Our next problem is this: your plane has just landed in England and
you rent a car. You have a meeting really soon and you have to get from
Heathrow Airport to London as fast as you can (but safely!).</p>
<p>There are two main roads going from Heathrow to London and there’s a
number of regional roads crossing them. It takes you a fixed amount of
time to travel from one crossroads to another. It’s up to you to find
the optimal path to take so that you get to London as fast as you can!
You start on the left side and can either cross to the other main road
or go forward.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/functionally-solving-problems/roads.png"
class="center" width="780" height="237" alt="Heathrow - London" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the picture, the shortest path from Heathrow to
London in this case is to start on main road B, cross over, go forward
on A, cross over again and then go forward twice on B. If we take this
path, it takes us 75 minutes. Had we chosen any other path, it would
take more than that.</p>
<p>Our job is to make a program that takes input that represents a road
system and print out what the shortest path across it is. Here’s what
the input would look like for this case:</p>
<pre class="plain"><code>50
10
30
5
90
20
40
2
25
10
8
0</code></pre>
<p>To mentally parse the input file, read it in threes and mentally
split the road system into sections. Each section is comprised of a road
A, road B and a crossing road. To have it neatly fit into threes, we say
that there’s a last crossing section that takes 0 minutes to drive over.
That’s because we don’t care where we arrive in London, as long as we’re
in London.</p>
<p>Just like we did when solving the RPN calculator problem, we’re going
to solve this problem in three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget Haskell for a minute and think about how we’d solve the
problem by hand</li>
<li>Think about how we’re going to represent our data in Haskell</li>
<li>Figure out how to operate on that data in Haskell so that we produce
at a solution</li>
</ul>
<p>In the RPN calculator section, we first figured out that when
calculating an expression by hand, we’d keep a sort of stack in our
minds and then go over the expression one item at a time. We decided to
use a list of strings to represent our expression. Finally, we used a
left fold to walk over the list of strings while keeping a stack to
produce a solution.</p>
<p>Okay, so how would we figure out the shortest path from Heathrow to
London by hand? Well, we can just sort of look at the whole picture and
try to guess what the shortest path is and hopefully we’ll make a guess
that’s right. That solution works for very small inputs, but what if we
have a road that has 10,000 sections? Yikes! We also won’t be able to
say for certain that our solution is the optimal one, we can just sort
of say that we’re pretty sure.</p>
<p>That’s not a good solution then. Here’s a simplified picture of our
road system:</p>
<p><img
src="assets/images/functionally-solving-problems/roads_simple.png"
class="center" width="685" height="245" alt="roads" /></p>
<p>Alright, can you figure out what the shortest path to the first
crossroads (the first blue dot on A, marked <em>A1</em>) on road A is?
That’s pretty trivial. We just see if it’s shorter to go directly
forward on A or if it’s shorter to go forward on B and then cross over.
Obviously, it’s cheaper to go forward via B and then cross over because
that takes 40 minutes, whereas going directly via A takes 50 minutes.
What about crossroads <em>B1</em>? Same thing. We see that it’s a lot
cheaper to just go directly via B (incurring a cost of 10 minutes),
because going via A and then crossing over would take us a whole 80
minutes!</p>
<p>Now we know what the cheapest path to <em>A1</em> is (go via B and
then cross over, so we’ll say that’s <code>B, C</code> with a cost of
40) and we know what the cheapest path to <em>B1</em> is (go directly
via B, so that’s just <code>B</code>, going at 10). Does this knowledge
help us at all if we want to know the cheapest path to the next
crossroads on both main roads? Gee golly, it sure does!</p>
<p>Let’s see what the shortest path to <em>A2</em> would be. To get to
<em>A2</em>, we’ll either go directly to <em>A2</em> from <em>A1</em> or
we’ll go forward from <em>B1</em> and then cross over (remember, we can
only move forward or cross to the other side). And because we know the
cost to <em>A1</em> and <em>B1</em>, we can easily figure out what the
best path to <em>A2</em> is. It costs 40 to get to <em>A1</em> and then
5 to get from <em>A1</em> to <em>A2</em>, so that’s <code>B, C, A</code>
for a cost of 45. It costs only 10 to get to <em>B1</em>, but then it
would take an additional 110 minutes to go to <em>B2</em> and then cross
over! So obviously, the cheapest path to <em>A2</em> is
<code>B, C, A</code>. In the same way, the cheapest way to <em>B2</em>
is to go forward from <em>A1</em> and then cross over.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Maybe you’re asking yourself</strong>: but what about getting
to <em>A2</em> by first crossing over at <em>B1</em> and then going on
forward? Well, we already covered crossing from <em>B1</em> to
<em>A1</em> when we were looking for the best way to <em>A1</em>, so we
don’t have to take that into account in the next step as well.</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have the best path to <em>A2</em> and <em>B2</em>, we can
repeat this indefinitely until we reach the end. Once we’ve gotten the
best paths for <em>A4</em> and <em>B4</em>, the one that’s cheaper is
the optimal path!</p>
<p>So in essence, for the second section, we just repeat the step we did
at first, only we take into account what the previous best paths on A
and B. We could say that we also took into account the best paths on A
and on B in the first step, only they were both empty paths with a cost
of 0.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary. To get the best path from Heathrow to London, we do
this: first we see what the best path to the next crossroads on main
road A is. The two options are going directly forward or starting at the
opposite road, going forward and then crossing over. We remember the
cost and the path. We use the same method to see what the best path to
the next crossroads on main road B is and remember that. Then, we see if
the path to the next crossroads on A is cheaper if we go from the
previous A crossroads or if we go from the previous B crossroads and
then cross over. We remember the cheaper path and then we do the same
for the crossroads opposite of it. We do this for every section until we
reach the end. Once we’ve reached the end, the cheapest of the two paths
that we have is our optimal path!</p>
<p>So in essence, we keep one shortest path on the A road and one
shortest path on the B road and when we reach the end, the shorter of
those two is our path. We now know how to figure out the shortest path
by hand. If you had enough time, paper and pencils, you could figure out
the shortest path through a road system with any number of sections.</p>
<p>Next step! How do we represent this road system with Haskell’s data
types? One way is to think of the starting points and crossroads as
nodes of a graph that point to other crossroads. If we imagine that the
starting points actually point to each other with a road that has a
length of one, we see that every crossroads (or node) points to the node
on the other side and also to the next one on its side. Except for the
last nodes, they just point to the other side.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Node = Node Road Road | EndNode Road
data Road = Road Int Node</code></pre>
<p>A node is either a normal node and has information about the road
that leads to the other main road and the road that leads to the next
node or an end node, which only has information about the road to the
other main road. A road keeps information about how long it is and which
node it points to. For instance, the first part of the road on the A
main road would be <code>Road 50 a1</code> where <code>a1</code> would
be a node <code>Node x y</code>, where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
are roads that point to <em>B1</em> and <em>A2</em>.</p>
<p>Another way would be to use <code>Maybe</code> for the road parts
that point forward. Each node has a road part that point to the opposite
road, but only those nodes that aren’t the end ones have road parts that
point forward.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Node = Node Road (Maybe Road)
data Road = Road Int Node</code></pre>
<p>This is an alright way to represent the road system in Haskell and we
could certainly solve this problem with it, but maybe we could come up
with something simpler? If we think back to our solution by hand, we
always just checked the lengths of three road parts at once: the road
part on the A road, its opposite part on the B road and part C, which
touches those two parts and connects them. When we were looking for the
shortest path to <em>A1</em> and <em>B1</em>, we only had to deal with
the lengths of the first three parts, which have lengths of 50, 10 and
30. We’ll call that one section. So the road system that we use for this
example can be easily represented as four sections:
<code>50, 10, 30</code>, <code>5, 90, 20</code>, <code>40, 2, 25</code>,
and <code>10, 8, 0</code>.</p>
<p>It’s always good to keep our data types as simple as possible,
although not any simpler!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Section = Section { getA :: Int, getB :: Int, getC :: Int } deriving (Show)
type RoadSystem = [Section]</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty much perfect! It’s as simple as it goes and I have a
feeling it’ll work perfectly for implementing our solution.
<code>Section</code> is a simple algebraic data type that holds three
integers for the lengths of its three road parts. We introduce a type
synonym as well, saying that <code>RoadSystem</code> is a list of
sections.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>We could also use a triple of <code>(Int, Int, Int)</code> to
represent a road section. Using tuples instead of making your own
algebraic data types is good for some small localized stuff, but it’s
usually better to make a new type for things like this. It gives the
type system more information about what’s what. We can use
<code>(Int, Int, Int)</code> to represent a road section or a vector in
3D space and we can operate on those two, but that allows us to mix them
up. If we use <code>Section</code> and <code>Vector</code> data types,
then we can’t accidentally add a vector to a section of a road
system.</p>
</div>
<p>Our road system from Heathrow to London can now be represented like
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>heathrowToLondon :: RoadSystem
heathrowToLondon = [Section 50 10 30, Section 5 90 20, Section 40 2 25, Section 10 8 0]</code></pre>
<p>All we need to do now is to implement the solution that we came up
with previously in Haskell. What should the type declaration for a
function that calculates a shortest path for any given road system be?
It should take a road system as a parameter and return a path. We’ll
represent a path as a list as well. Let’s introduce a <code>Label</code>
type that’s just an enumeration of either <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>
or <code>C</code>. We’ll also make a type synonym:
<code>Path</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Label = A | B | C deriving (Show)
type Path = [(Label, Int)]</code></pre>
<p>Our function, we’ll call it <code>optimalPath</code> should thus have
a type declaration of <code>optimalPath :: RoadSystem -&gt; Path</code>.
If called with the road system <code>heathrowToLondon</code>, it should
return the following path:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>[(B,10),(C,30),(A,5),(C,20),(B,2),(B,8)]</code></pre>
<p>We’re going to have to walk over the list with the sections from left
to right and keep the optimal path on A and optimal path on B as we go
along. We’ll accumulate the best path as we walk over the list, left to
right. What does that sound like? Ding, ding, ding! That’s right, A LEFT
FOLD!</p>
<p>When doing the solution by hand, there was a step that we repeated
over and over again. It involved checking the optimal paths on A and B
so far and the current section to produce the new optimal paths on A and
B. For instance, at the beginning the optimal paths were <code>[]</code>
and <code>[]</code> for A and B respectively. We examined the section
<code>Section 50 10 30</code> and concluded that the new optimal path to
<em>A1</em> is <code>[(B,10),(C,30)]</code> and the optimal path to
<em>B1</em> is <code>[(B,10)]</code>. If you look at this step as a
function, it takes a pair of paths and a section and produces a new pair
of paths. The type is
<code>(Path, Path) -&gt; Section -&gt; (Path, Path)</code>. Let’s go
ahead and implement this function, because it’s bound to be useful.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> it will be useful because
<code>(Path, Path) -&gt; Section -&gt; (Path, Path)</code> can be used
as the binary function for a left fold, which has to have a type of
<code>a -&gt; b -&gt; a</code></p>
</div>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>roadStep :: (Path, Path) -&gt; Section -&gt; (Path, Path)
roadStep (pathA, pathB) (Section a b c) =
    let priceA = sum $ map snd pathA
        priceB = sum $ map snd pathB
        forwardPriceToA = priceA + a
        crossPriceToA = priceB + b + c
        forwardPriceToB = priceB + b
        crossPriceToB = priceA + a + c
        newPathToA = if forwardPriceToA &lt;= crossPriceToA
                        then (A,a):pathA
                        else (C,c):(B,b):pathB
        newPathToB = if forwardPriceToB &lt;= crossPriceToB
                        then (B,b):pathB
                        else (C,c):(A,a):pathA
    in  (newPathToA, newPathToB)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/functionally-solving-problems/guycar.png"
class="right" width="420" height="381" alt="this is you" /></p>
<p>What’s going on here? First, calculate the optimal price on road A
based on the best so far on A and we do the same for B. We do
<code>sum $ map snd pathA</code>, so if <code>pathA</code> is something
like <code>[(A,100),(C,20)]</code>, <code>priceA</code> becomes
<code>120</code>. <code>forwardPriceToA</code> is the price that we
would pay if we went to the next crossroads on A if we went there
directly from the previous crossroads on A. It equals the best price to
our previous A, plus the length of the A part of the current section.
<code>crossPriceToA</code> is the price that we would pay if we went to
the next A by going forward from the previous B and then crossing over.
It’s the best price to the previous B so far plus the B length of the
section plus the C length of the section. We determine
<code>forwardPriceToB</code> and <code>crossPriceToB</code> in the same
manner.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the best way to A and B is, we just need to
make the new paths to A and B based on that. If it’s cheaper to go to A
by just going forwards, we set <code>newPathToA</code> to be
<code>(A,a):pathA</code>. Basically we prepend the <code>Label</code>
<code>A</code> and the section length <code>a</code> to the optimal path
path on A so far. Basically, we say that the best path to the next A
crossroads is the path to the previous A crossroads and then one section
forward via A. Remember, <code>A</code> is just a label, whereas
<code>a</code> has a type of <code>Int</code>. Why do we prepend instead
of doing <code>pathA ++ [(A,a)]</code>? Well, adding an element to the
beginning of a list (also known as consing) is much faster than adding
it to the end. This means that the path will be the wrong way around
once we fold over a list with this function, but it’s easy to reverse
the list later. If it’s cheaper to get to the next A crossroads by going
forward from road B and then crossing over, then <code>newPathToA</code>
is the old path to B that then goes forward and crosses to A. We do the
same thing for <code>newPathToB</code>, only everything’s mirrored.</p>
<p>Finally, we return <code>newPathToA</code> and
<code>newPathToB</code> in a pair.</p>
<p>Let’s run this function on the first section of
<code>heathrowToLondon</code>. Because it’s the first section, the best
paths on A and B parameter will be a pair of empty lists.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; roadStep ([], []) (head heathrowToLondon)
([(C,30),(B,10)],[(B,10)])</code></pre>
<p>Remember, the paths are reversed, so read them from right to left.
From this we can read that the best path to the next A is to start on B
and then cross over to A and that the best path to the next B is to just
go directly forward from the starting point at B.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Optimization tip:</strong> when we do
<code>priceA = sum $ map snd pathA</code>, we’re calculating the price
from the path on every step. We wouldn’t have to do that if we
implemented <code>roadStep</code> as a
<code>(Path, Path, Int, Int) -&gt; Section -&gt; (Path, Path, Int, Int)</code>
function where the integers represent the best price on A and B.</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have a function that takes a pair of paths and a section
and produces a new optimal path, we can just easily do a left fold over
a list of sections. <code>roadStep</code> is called with
<code>([],[])</code> and the first section and returns a pair of optimal
paths to that section. Then, it’s called with that pair of paths and the
next section and so on. When we’ve walked over all the sections, we’re
left with a pair of optimal paths and the shorter of them is our answer.
With this in mind, we can implement <code>optimalPath</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>optimalPath :: RoadSystem -&gt; Path
optimalPath roadSystem =
    let (bestAPath, bestBPath) = foldl roadStep ([],[]) roadSystem
    in  if sum (map snd bestAPath) &lt;= sum (map snd bestBPath)
            then reverse bestAPath
            else reverse bestBPath</code></pre>
<p>We left fold over <code>roadSystem</code> (remember, it’s a list of
sections) with the starting accumulator being a pair of empty paths. The
result of that fold is a pair of paths, so we pattern match on the pair
to get the paths themselves. Then, we check which one of these was
cheaper and return it. Before returning it, we also reverse it, because
the optimal paths so far were reversed due to us choosing consing over
appending.</p>
<p>Let’s test this!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; optimalPath heathrowToLondon
[(B,10),(C,30),(A,5),(C,20),(B,2),(B,8),(C,0)]</code></pre>
<p>This is the result that we were supposed to get! Awesome! It differs
from our expected result a bit because there’s a step <code>(C,0)</code>
at the end, which means that we cross over to the other road once we’re
in London, but because that crossing doesn’t cost anything, this is
still the correct result.</p>
<p>We have the function that finds an optimal path based on, now we just
have to read a textual representation of a road system from the standard
input, convert it into a type of <code>RoadSystem</code>, run that
through our <code>optimalPath</code> function and print the path.</p>
<p>First off, let’s make a function that takes a list and splits it into
groups of the same size. We’ll call it <code>groupsOf</code>. For a
parameter of <code>[1..10]</code>, <code>groupsOf 3</code> should return
<code>[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10]]</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>groupsOf :: Int -&gt; [a] -&gt; [[a]]
groupsOf 0 _ = undefined
groupsOf _ [] = []
groupsOf n xs = take n xs : groupsOf n (drop n xs)</code></pre>
<p>A standard recursive function. For an <code>xs</code> of
<code>[1..10]</code> and an <code>n</code> of <code>3</code>, this
equals <code>[1,2,3] : groupsOf 3 [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]</code>. When the
recursion is done, we get our list in groups of three. And here’s our
<code>main</code> function, which reads from the standard input, makes a
<code>RoadSystem</code> out of it and prints out the shortest path:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import Data.List

main = do
    contents &lt;- getContents
    let threes = groupsOf 3 (map read $ lines contents)
        roadSystem = map (\[a,b,c] -&gt; Section a b c) threes
        path = optimalPath roadSystem
        pathString = concat $ map (show . fst) path
        pathPrice = sum $ map snd path
    putStrLn $ &quot;The best path to take is: &quot; ++ pathString
    putStrLn $ &quot;The price is: &quot; ++ show pathPrice</code></pre>
<p>First, we get all the contents from the standard input. Then, we call
<code>lines</code> with our contents to convert something like
<code>"50\n10\n30\n...</code> to <code>["50","10","30"..</code> and then
we map <code>read</code> to that to convert it to a list of numbers. We
call <code>groupsOf 3</code> on it so that we turn it to a list of lists
of length 3. We map the lambda
<code>(\[a,b,c] -&gt; Section a b c)</code> over that list of lists. As
you can see, the lambda just takes a list of length 3 and turns it into
a section. So <code>roadSystem</code> is now our system of roads and it
even has the correct type, namely <code>RoadSystem</code> (or
<code>[Section]</code>). We call <code>optimalPath</code> with that and
then get the path and the price in a nice textual representation and
print it out.</p>
<p>We save the following text</p>
<pre class="plain"><code>50
10
30
5
90
20
40
2
25
10
8
0</code></pre>
<p>in a file called <code>paths.txt</code> and then feed it to our
program.</p>
<pre class="plain"><code>$ cat paths.txt | runhaskell heathrow.hs
The best path to take is: BCACBBC
The price is: 75</code></pre>
<p>Works like a charm! You can use your knowledge of the
<code>Data.Random</code> module to generate a much longer system of
roads, which you can then feed to what we just wrote. If you get stack
overflows, try using <code>foldl'</code> instead of <code>foldl</code>,
because <code>foldl'</code> is strict.</p>
