<h2 id="believe-the-type">Believe the type</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/types-and-typeclasses/cow.png" class="left"

<p>Previously we mentioned that Haskell has a static type system. The
type of every expression is known at compile time, which leads to safer
code. If you write a program where you try to divide a boolean type with
some number, it won’t even compile. That’s good because it’s better to
catch such errors at compile time instead of having your program crash.
Everything in Haskell has a type, so the compiler can reason quite a lot
about your program before compiling it.</p>
<p>Unlike Java or Pascal, Haskell has type inference. If we write a
number, we don’t have to tell Haskell it’s a number. It can
<em>infer</em> that on its own, so we don’t have to explicitly write out
the types of our functions and expressions to get things done. We
covered some of the basics of Haskell with only a very superficial
glance at types. However, understanding the type system is a very
important part of learning Haskell.</p>
<p>A type is a kind of label that every expression has. It tells us in
which category of things that expression fits. The expression
<code>True</code> is a boolean, <code>"hello"</code> is a string,
etc.</p>
<p>Now we’ll use GHCI to examine the types of some expressions. We’ll do
that by using the <code>:t</code> command which, followed by any valid
expression, tells us its type. Let’s give it a whirl.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t &#39;a&#39;
&#39;a&#39; :: Char
ghci&gt; :t True
True :: Bool
ghci&gt; :t &quot;HELLO!&quot;
&quot;HELLO!&quot; :: [Char]
ghci&gt; :t (True, &#39;a&#39;)
(True, &#39;a&#39;) :: (Bool, Char)
ghci&gt; :t 4 == 5
4 == 5 :: Bool</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/types-and-typeclasses/bomb.png" class="right"
width="171" height="144" alt="bomb" /> Here we see that doing
<code>:t</code> on an expression prints out the expression followed by
<code>::</code> and its type. <code>::</code> is read as “has type of”.
Explicit types are always denoted with the first letter in capital case.
<code>'a'</code>, as it would seem, has a type of <code>Char</code>.
It’s not hard to conclude that it stands for <em>character</em>.
<code>True</code> is of a <code>Bool</code> type. That makes sense. But
what’s this? Examining the type of <code>"HELLO!"</code> yields a
<code>[Char]</code>. The square brackets denote a list. So we read that
as it being <em>a list of characters</em>. Unlike lists, each tuple
length has its own type. So the expression of <code>(True, 'a')</code>
has a type of <code>(Bool, Char)</code>, whereas an expression such as
<code>('a','b','c')</code> would have the type of
<code>(Char, Char, Char)</code>. <code>4 == 5</code> will always return
<code>False</code>, so its type is <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Functions also have types. When writing our own functions, we can
choose to give them an explicit type declaration. This is generally
considered to be good practice except when writing very short functions.
From here on, we’ll give all the functions that we make type
declarations. Remember the list comprehension we made previously that
filters a string so that only caps remain? Here’s how it looks like with
a type declaration.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>removeNonUppercase :: [Char] -&gt; [Char]
removeNonUppercase st = [ c | c &lt;- st, c `elem` [&#39;A&#39;..&#39;Z&#39;]]</code></pre>
<p><code>removeNonUppercase</code> has a type of
<code>[Char] -&gt; [Char]</code>, meaning that it maps from a string to
a string. That’s because it takes one string as a parameter and returns
another as a result. The <code>[Char]</code> type is synonymous with
<code>String</code> so it’s clearer if we write
<code>removeNonUppercase :: String -&gt; String</code>. We didn’t have
to give this function a type declaration because the compiler can infer
by itself that it’s a function from a string to a string but we did
anyway. But how do we write out the type of a function that takes
several parameters? Here’s a simple function that takes three integers
and adds them together:</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>addThree :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
addThree x y z = x + y + z</code></pre>
<p>The parameters are separated with <code>-&gt;</code> and there’s no
special distinction between the parameters and the return type. The
return type is the last item in the declaration and the parameters are
the first three. Later on we’ll see why they’re all just separated with
<code>-&gt;</code> instead of having some more explicit distinction
between the return types and the parameters like
<code>Int, Int, Int -&gt; Int</code> or something.</p>
<p>If you want to give your function a type declaration but are unsure
as to what it should be, you can always just write the function without
it and then check it with <code>:t</code>. Functions are expressions
too, so <code>:t</code> works on them without a problem.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of some common types.</p>
<p><code class="label type">Int</code> stands for integer. It’s used for
whole numbers. <code>7</code> can be an <code>Int</code> but
<code>7.2</code> cannot. <code>Int</code> is bounded, which means that
it has a minimum and a maximum value. Usually on 32-bit machines the
maximum possible <code>Int</code> is 2147483647 and the minimum is
-2147483648.</p>
<p><code class="label type">Integer</code> stands for, er … also
integer. The main difference is that it’s not bounded so it can be used
to represent really really big numbers. I mean like really big.
<code>Int</code>, however, is more efficient.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>factorial :: Integer -&gt; Integer
factorial n = product [1..n]</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; factorial 50
30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000</code></pre>
<p><code class="label type">Float</code> is a real floating point with
single precision.</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>circumference :: Float -&gt; Float
circumference r = 2 * pi * r</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; circumference 4.0
25.132742</code></pre>
<p><code class="label type">Double</code> is a real floating point with
double the precision!</p>
<pre class="haskell: hs"><code>circumference&#39; :: Double -&gt; Double
circumference&#39; r = 2 * pi * r</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; circumference&#39; 4.0
25.132741228718345</code></pre>
<p><code class="label type">Bool</code> is a boolean type. It can have
only two values: <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>.</p>
<p><code class="label type">Char</code> represents a character. It’s
denoted by single quotes. A list of characters is a string.</p>
<p>Tuples are types but they are dependent on their length as well as
the types of their components, so there is theoretically an infinite
number of tuple types, which is too many to cover in this tutorial. Note
that the empty tuple <code class="label type">()</code> is also a type
which can only have a single value: <code>()</code></p>
<h2 id="type-variables">Type variables</h2>
<p>What do you think is the type of the <code>head</code> function?
Because <code>head</code> takes a list of any type and returns the first
element, so what could it be? Let’s check!</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t head
head :: [a] -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/types-and-typeclasses/box.png" class="left"
width="130" height="93" alt="box" /> Hmmm! What is this <code>a</code>?
Is it a type? Remember that we previously stated that types are written
in capital case, so it can’t exactly be a type. Because it’s not in
capital case it’s actually a <strong>type variable</strong>. That means
that <code>a</code> can be of any type. This is much like generics in
other languages, only in Haskell it’s much more powerful because it
allows us to easily write very general functions if they don’t use any
specific behavior of the types in them. Functions that have type
variables are called <strong>polymorphic functions</strong>. The type
declaration of <code>head</code> states that it takes a list of any type
and returns one element of that type.</p>
<p>Although type variables can have names longer than one character, we
usually give them names of a, b, c, d …</p>
<p>Remember <code>fst</code>? It returns the first component of a pair.
Let’s examine its type.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t fst
fst :: (a, b) -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>We see that <code>fst</code> takes a tuple which contains two types
and returns an element which is of the same type as the pair’s first
component. That’s why we can use <code>fst</code> on a pair that
contains any two types. Note that just because <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> are different type variables, they don’t have to be
different types. It just states that the first component’s type and the
return value’s type are the same.</p>
<h2 id="typeclasses-101">Typeclasses 101</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/types-and-typeclasses/classes.png"
class="right" width="210" height="158" alt="class" /></p>
<p>A typeclass is a sort of interface that defines some behavior. If a
type is a part of a typeclass, that means that it supports and
implements the behavior the typeclass describes. A lot of people coming
from OOP get confused by typeclasses because they think they are like
classes in object oriented languages. Well, they’re not. You can think
of them kind of as Java interfaces, only better.</p>
<p>What’s the type signature of the <code>==</code> function?</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t (==)
(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code></pre>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the equality operator, <code>==</code> is a
function. So are <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>-</code>,
<code>/</code> and pretty much all operators. If a function is comprised
only of special characters, it’s considered an infix function by
default. If we want to examine its type, pass it to another function or
call it as a prefix function, we have to surround it in parentheses.</p>
</div>
<p>Interesting. We see a new thing here, the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol.
Everything before the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol is called a
<strong>class constraint</strong>. We can read the previous type
declaration like this: the equality function takes any two values that
are of the same type and returns a <code>Bool</code>. The type of those
two values must be a member of the <code>Eq</code> class (this was the
class constraint).</p>
<p>The <code>Eq</code> typeclass provides an interface for testing for
equality. Any type where it makes sense to test for equality between two
values of that type should be a member of the <code>Eq</code> class. All
standard Haskell types except for IO (the type for dealing with input
and output) and functions are a part of the <code>Eq</code>
typeclass.</p>
<p>The <code>elem</code> function has a type of
<code>(Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</code> because it uses
<code>==</code> over a list to check whether some value we’re looking
for is in it.</p>
<p>Some basic typeclasses:</p>
<p><code class="label class">Eq</code> is used for types that support
equality testing. The functions its members implement are
<code>==</code> and <code>/=</code>. So if there’s an <code>Eq</code>
class constraint for a type variable in a function, it uses
<code>==</code> or <code>/=</code> somewhere inside its definition. All
the types we mentioned previously except for functions are part of
<code>Eq</code>, so they can be tested for equality.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; 5 == 5
True
ghci&gt; 5 /= 5
False
ghci&gt; &#39;a&#39; == &#39;a&#39;
True
ghci&gt; &quot;Ho Ho&quot; == &quot;Ho Ho&quot;
True
ghci&gt; 3.432 == 3.432
True</code></pre>
<p><code class="label class">Ord</code> is for types that have an
ordering.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t (&gt;)
(&gt;) :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code></pre>
<p>All the types we covered so far except for functions are part of
<code>Ord</code>. <code>Ord</code> covers all the standard comparing
functions such as <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>,
<code>&gt;=</code> and <code>&lt;=</code>. The <code>compare</code>
function takes two <code>Ord</code> members of the same type and returns
an ordering. <code class="label type">Ordering</code> is a type that can
be <code>GT</code>, <code>LT</code> or <code>EQ</code>, meaning
<em>greater than</em>, <em>lesser than</em> and <em>equal</em>,
respectively.</p>
<p>To be a member of <code>Ord</code>, a type must first have membership
in the prestigious and exclusive <code>Eq</code> club.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; &quot;Abrakadabra&quot; &lt; &quot;Zebra&quot;
True
ghci&gt; &quot;Abrakadabra&quot; `compare` &quot;Zebra&quot;
LT
ghci&gt; 5 &gt;= 2
True
ghci&gt; 5 `compare` 3
GT</code></pre>
<p>Members of <code class="label class">Show</code> can be presented as
strings. All types covered so far except for functions are a part of
<code>Show</code>. The most used function that deals with the
<code>Show</code> typeclass is <code>show</code>. It takes a value whose
type is a member of <code>Show</code> and presents it to us as a
string.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; show 3
&quot;3&quot;
ghci&gt; show 5.334
&quot;5.334&quot;
ghci&gt; show True
&quot;True&quot;</code></pre>
<p><code class="label class">Read</code> is sort of the opposite
typeclass of <code>Show</code>. The <code>read</code> function takes a
string and returns a type which is a member of <code>Read</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; read &quot;True&quot; || False
True
ghci&gt; read &quot;8.2&quot; + 3.8
12.0
ghci&gt; read &quot;5&quot; - 2
3
ghci&gt; read &quot;[1,2,3,4]&quot; ++ [3]
[1,2,3,4,3]</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. Again, all types covered so far are in this
typeclass. But what happens if we try to do just
<code>read "4"</code>?</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; read &quot;4&quot;
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `a&#39; in the constraint:
      `Read a&#39; arising from a use of `read&#39; at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-7
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)</code></pre>
<p>What GHCI is telling us here is that it doesn’t know what we want in
return. Notice that in the previous uses of <code>read</code> we did
something with the result afterwards. That way, GHCI could infer what
kind of result we wanted out of our <code>read</code>. If we used it as
a boolean, it knew it had to return a <code>Bool</code>. But now, it
knows we want some type that is part of the <code>Read</code> class, it
just doesn’t know which one. Let’s take a look at the type signature of
<code>read</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t read
read :: (Read a) =&gt; String -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>See? It returns a type that’s part of <code>Read</code> but if we
don’t try to use it in some way later, it has no way of knowing which
type. That’s why we can use explicit <strong>type annotations</strong>.
Type annotations are a way of explicitly saying what the type of an
expression should be. We do that by adding <code>::</code> at the end of
the expression and then specifying a type. Observe:</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; read &quot;5&quot; :: Int
5
ghci&gt; read &quot;5&quot; :: Float
5.0
ghci&gt; (read &quot;5&quot; :: Float) * 4
20.0
ghci&gt; read &quot;[1,2,3,4]&quot; :: [Int]
[1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; read &quot;(3, &#39;a&#39;)&quot; :: (Int, Char)
(3, &#39;a&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Most expressions are such that the compiler can infer what their type
is by itself. But sometimes, the compiler doesn’t know whether to return
a value of type <code>Int</code> or <code>Float</code> for an expression
like <code>read "5"</code>. To see what the type is, Haskell would have
to actually evaluate <code>read "5"</code>. But since Haskell is a
statically typed language, it has to know all the types before the code
is compiled (or in the case of GHCI, evaluated). So we have to tell
Haskell: “Hey, this expression should have this type, in case you don’t
know!”.</p>
<p><code class="label class">Enum</code> members are sequentially
ordered types — they can be enumerated. The main advantage of the
<code>Enum</code> typeclass is that we can use its types in list ranges.
They also have defined successors and predecessors, which you can get
with the <code>succ</code> and <code>pred</code> functions. Types in
this class: <code>()</code>, <code>Bool</code>, <code>Char</code>,
<code>Ordering</code>, <code>Int</code>, <code>Integer</code>,
<code>Float</code> and <code>Double</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; [&#39;a&#39;..&#39;e&#39;]
&quot;abcde&quot;
ghci&gt; [LT .. GT]
[LT,EQ,GT]
ghci&gt; [3 .. 5]
[3,4,5]
ghci&gt; succ &#39;B&#39;
&#39;C&#39;</code></pre>
<p><code class="label class">Bounded</code> members have an upper and a
lower bound.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; minBound :: Int
-2147483648
ghci&gt; maxBound :: Char
&#39;\1114111&#39;
ghci&gt; maxBound :: Bool
True
ghci&gt; minBound :: Bool
False</code></pre>
<p><code>minBound</code> and <code>maxBound</code> are interesting
because they have a type of <code>(Bounded a) =&gt; a</code>. In a sense
they are polymorphic constants.</p>
<p>All tuples are also part of <code>Bounded</code> if the components
are also in it.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; maxBound :: (Bool, Int, Char)
(True,2147483647,&#39;\1114111&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><code class="label class">Num</code> is a numeric typeclass. Its
members have the property of being able to act like numbers. Let’s
examine the type of a number.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t 20
20 :: (Num t) =&gt; t</code></pre>
<p>It appears that whole numbers are also polymorphic constants. They
can act like any type that’s a member of the <code>Num</code>
typeclass.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; 20 :: Int
20
ghci&gt; 20 :: Integer
20
ghci&gt; 20 :: Float
20.0
ghci&gt; 20 :: Double
20.0</code></pre>
<p>Those are types that are in the <code>Num</code> typeclass. If we
examine the type of <code>*</code>, we’ll see that it accepts all
numbers.</p>
<pre class="haskell: ghci"><code>ghci&gt; :t (*)
(*) :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>It takes two numbers of the same type and returns a number of that
type. That’s why <code>(5 :: Int) * (6 :: Integer)</code> will result in
a type error whereas <code>5 * (6 :: Integer)</code> will work just fine
and produce an <code>Integer</code> because <code>5</code> can act like
an <code>Integer</code> or an <code>Int</code>.</p>
<p>To join <code>Num</code>, a type must already be friends with
<code>Show</code> and <code>Eq</code>.</p>
<p><code class="class label">Integral</code> is also a numeric
typeclass. <code>Num</code> includes all numbers, including real numbers
and integral numbers, <code>Integral</code> includes only integral
(whole) numbers. In this typeclass are <code>Int</code> and
<code>Integer</code>.</p>
<p><code class="class label">Floating</code> includes only floating
point numbers, so <code>Float</code> and <code>Double</code>.</p>
<p>A very useful function for dealing with numbers is <code
class="label function">fromIntegral</code>. It has a type declaration of
<code>fromIntegral :: (Num b, Integral a) =&gt; a -&gt; b</code>. From
its type signature we see that it takes an integral number and turns it
into a more general number. That’s useful when you want integral and
floating point types to work together nicely. For instance, the
<code>length</code> function has a type declaration of
<code>length :: [a] -&gt; Int</code> instead of having a more general
type of <code>(Num b) =&gt; length :: [a] -&gt; b</code>. If we try to
get a length of a list and then add it to <code>3.2</code>, we’ll get an
error because we tried to add together an <code>Int</code> and a
floating point number. So to get around this, we do
<code>fromIntegral (length [1,2,3,4]) + 3.2</code> and it all works
out.</p>
<p>Notice that <code>fromIntegral</code> has several class constraints
in its type signature. That’s completely valid and as you can see, the
class constraints are separated by commas inside the parentheses.</p>
