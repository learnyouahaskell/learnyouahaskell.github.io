<h1 style="margin-left:-3px" id="higher-order-functions">Higher Order
Functions</h1>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/sun.png" class="right"
width="203" height="183" alt="sun" /></p>
<p>Haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return
functions as return values. A function that does either of those is
called a higher order function. Higher order functions aren’t just a
part of the Haskell experience, they pretty much are the Haskell
experience. It turns out that if you want to define computations by
defining what stuff <em>is</em> instead of defining steps that change
some state and maybe looping them, higher order functions are
indispensable. They’re a really powerful way of solving problems and
thinking about programs.</p>
<h2 id="curried-functions">Curried functions</h2>
<p>Every function in Haskell officially only takes one parameter. So how
is it possible that we defined and used several functions that take more
than one parameter so far? Well, it’s a clever trick! All the functions
that accepted <em>several parameters</em> so far have been
<strong>curried functions</strong>. What does that mean? You’ll
understand it best on an example. Let’s take our good friend, the
<code>max</code> function. It looks like it takes two parameters and
returns the one that’s bigger. Doing <code>max 4 5</code> first creates
a function that takes a parameter and returns either <code>4</code> or
that parameter, depending on which is bigger. Then, <code>5</code> is
applied to that function and that function produces our desired result.
That sounds like a mouthful but it’s actually a really cool concept. The
following two calls are equivalent:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; max 4 5
5
ghci&gt; (max 4) 5
5</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/curry.png"
class="left" width="160" height="238" alt="haskell curry" /></p>
<p>Putting a space between two things is simply <strong>function
application</strong>. The space is sort of like an operator and it has
the highest precedence. Let’s examine the type of <code>max</code>. It’s
<code>max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>. That can also be
written as <code>max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a)</code>. That
could be read as: <code>max</code> takes an <code>a</code> and returns
(that’s the <code>-&gt;</code>) a function that takes an <code>a</code>
and returns an <code>a</code>. That’s why the return type and the
parameters of functions are all simply separated with arrows.</p>
<p>So how is that beneficial to us? Simply speaking, if we call a
function with too few parameters, we get back a <strong>partially
applied</strong> function, meaning a function that takes as many
parameters as we left out. Using partial application (calling functions
with too few parameters, if you will) is a neat way to create functions
on the fly so we can pass them to another function or to seed them with
some data.</p>
<p>Take a look at this offensively simple function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>multThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
multThree x y z = x * y * z</code></pre>
<p>What really happens when we do <code>multThree 3 5 9</code> or
<code>((multThree 3) 5) 9</code>? First, <code>3</code> is applied to
<code>multThree</code>, because they’re separated by a space. That
creates a function that takes one parameter and returns a function. So
then <code>5</code> is applied to that, which creates a function that
will take a parameter and multiply it by 15. <code>9</code> is applied
to that function and the result is 135 or something. Remember that this
function’s type could also be written as
<code>multThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; (a -&gt; a))</code>.
The thing before the <code>-&gt;</code> is the parameter that a function
takes and the thing after it is what it returns. So our function takes
an <code>a</code> and returns a function of type
<code>(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a)</code>. Similarly, this function
takes an <code>a</code> and returns a function of type
<code>(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a</code>. And this function, finally, just
takes an <code>a</code> and returns an <code>a</code>. Take a look at
this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; let multTwoWithNine = multThree 9
ghci&gt; multTwoWithNine 2 3
54
ghci&gt; let multWithEighteen = multTwoWithNine 2
ghci&gt; multWithEighteen 10
180</code></pre>
<p>By calling functions with too few parameters, so to speak, we’re
creating new functions on the fly. What if we wanted to create a
function that takes a number and compares it to <code>100</code>? We
could do something like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>compareWithHundred :: (Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
compareWithHundred x = compare 100 x</code></pre>
<p>If we call it with <code>99</code>, it returns a <code>GT</code>.
Simple stuff. Notice that the <code>x</code> is on the right-hand side
on both sides of the equation. Now let’s think about what
<code>compare 100</code> returns. It returns a function that takes a
number and compares it with <code>100</code>. Wow! Isn’t that the
function we wanted? We can rewrite this as:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>compareWithHundred :: (Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
compareWithHundred = compare 100</code></pre>
<p>The type declaration stays the same, because <code>compare 100</code>
returns a function. Compare has a type of
<code>(Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; Ordering)</code> and calling it
with <code>100</code> returns a
<code>(Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering</code>. The additional class
constraint sneaks up there because <code>100</code> is also part of the
<code>Num</code> typeclass.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Yo!</strong> Make sure you really understand how curried
functions and partial application work because they’re really
important!</p>
</div>
<p>Infix functions can also be partially applied by using sections. To
section an infix function, simply surround it with parentheses and only
supply a parameter on one side. That creates a function that takes one
parameter and then applies it to the side that’s missing an operand. An
insultingly trivial function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>divideByTen :: (Floating a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
divideByTen = (/10)</code></pre>
<p>Calling, say, <code>divideByTen 200</code> is equivalent to doing
<code>200 / 10</code>, as is doing <code>(/10) 200</code>. A function
that checks if a character supplied to it is an uppercase letter:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>isUpperAlphanum :: Char -&gt; Bool
isUpperAlphanum = (`elem` [&#39;A&#39;..&#39;Z&#39;])</code></pre>
<p>The only special thing about sections is using <code>-</code>. From
the definition of sections, <code>(-4)</code> would result in a function
that takes a number and subtracts 4 from it. However, for convenience,
<code>(-4)</code> means minus four. So if you want to make a function
that subtracts 4 from the number it gets as a parameter, partially apply
the <code>subtract</code> function like so:
<code>(subtract 4)</code>.</p>
<p>What happens if we try to just do <code>multThree 3 4</code> in GHCI
instead of binding it to a name with a <em>let</em> or passing it to
another function?</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; multThree 3 4
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Show (t -&gt; t))
      arising from a use of `print&#39; at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-12
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (t -&gt; t))
    In the expression: print it
    In a &#39;do&#39; expression: print it</code></pre>
<p>GHCI is telling us that the expression produced a function of type
<code>a -&gt; a</code> but it doesn’t know how to print it to the
screen. Functions aren’t instances of the <code>Show</code> typeclass,
so we can’t get a neat string representation of a function. When we do,
say, <code>1 + 1</code> at the GHCI prompt, it first calculates that to
<code>2</code> and then calls <code>show</code> on <code>2</code> to get
a textual representation of that number. And the textual representation
of <code>2</code> is just the string <code>"2"</code>, which then gets
printed to our screen.</p>
<h2 id="higher-orderism">Some higher-orderism is in order</h2>
<p>Functions can take functions as parameters and also return functions.
To illustrate this, we’re going to make a function that takes a function
and then applies it twice to something!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>applyTwice :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
applyTwice f x = f (f x)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/bonus.png"
class="right" width="166" height="190" alt="rocktopus" /></p>
<p>First of all, notice the type declaration. Before, we didn’t need
parentheses because <code>-&gt;</code> is naturally right-associative.
However, here, they’re mandatory. They indicate that the first parameter
is a function that takes something and returns that same thing. The
second parameter is something of that type also and the return value is
also of the same type. We could read this type declaration in the
curried way, but to save ourselves a headache, we’ll just say that this
function takes two parameters and returns one thing. The first parameter
is a function (of type <code>a -&gt; a</code>) and the second is that
same <code>a</code>. The function can also be <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>
or <code>String -&gt; String</code> or whatever. But then, the second
parameter to also has to be of that type.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From now on, we’ll say that functions take
several parameters despite each function actually taking only one
parameter and returning partially applied functions until we reach a
function that returns a solid value. So for simplicity’s sake, we’ll say
that <code>a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code> takes two parameters, even though we
know what’s really going on under the hood.</p>
</div>
<p>The body of the function is pretty simple. We just use the parameter
<code>f</code> as a function, applying <code>x</code> to it by
separating them with a space and then applying the result to
<code>f</code> again. Anyway, playing around with the function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; applyTwice (+3) 10
16
ghci&gt; applyTwice (++ &quot; HAHA&quot;) &quot;HEY&quot;
&quot;HEY HAHA HAHA&quot;
ghci&gt; applyTwice (&quot;HAHA &quot; ++) &quot;HEY&quot;
&quot;HAHA HAHA HEY&quot;
ghci&gt; applyTwice (multThree 2 2) 9
144
ghci&gt; applyTwice (3:) [1]
[3,3,1]</code></pre>
<p>The awesomeness and usefulness of partial application is evident. If
our function requires us to pass it a function that takes only one
parameter, we can just partially apply a function to the point where it
takes only one parameter and then pass it.</p>
<p>Now we’re going to use higher order programming to implement a really
useful function that’s in the standard library. It’s called
<code>zipWith</code>. It takes a function and two lists as parameters
and then joins the two lists by applying the function between
corresponding elements. Here’s how we’ll implement it:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>zipWith&#39; :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [c]
zipWith&#39; _ [] _ = []
zipWith&#39; _ _ [] = []
zipWith&#39; f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith&#39; f xs ys</code></pre>
<p>Look at the type declaration. The first parameter is a function that
takes two things and produces a third thing. They don’t have to be of
the same type, but they can. The second and third parameter are lists.
The result is also a list. The first has to be a list of
<code>a</code>’s, because the joining function takes <code>a</code>’s as
its first argument. The second has to be a list of <code>b</code>’s,
because the second parameter of the joining function is of type
<code>b</code>. The result is a list of <code>c</code>’s. If the type
declaration of a function says it accepts an
<code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c</code> function as a parameter, it will also
accept an <code>a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code> function, but not the other way
around! Remember that when you’re making functions, especially higher
order ones, and you’re unsure of the type, you can just try omitting the
type declaration and then checking what Haskell infers it to be by using
<code>:t</code>.</p>
<p>The action in the function is pretty similar to the normal
<code>zip</code>. The edge conditions are the same, only there’s an
extra argument, the joining function, but that argument doesn’t matter
in the edge conditions, so we just use a <code>_</code> for it. And
function body at the last pattern is also similar to <code>zip</code>,
only it doesn’t do <code>(x,y)</code>, but <code>f x y</code>. A single
higher order function can be used for a multitude of different tasks if
it’s general enough. Here’s a little demonstration of all the different
things our <code>zipWith'</code> function can do:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; zipWith&#39; (+) [4,2,5,6] [2,6,2,3]
[6,8,7,9]
ghci&gt; zipWith&#39; max [6,3,2,1] [7,3,1,5]
[7,3,2,5]
ghci&gt; zipWith&#39; (++) [&quot;foo &quot;, &quot;bar &quot;, &quot;baz &quot;] [&quot;fighters&quot;, &quot;hoppers&quot;, &quot;aldrin&quot;]
[&quot;foo fighters&quot;,&quot;bar hoppers&quot;,&quot;baz aldrin&quot;]
ghci&gt; zipWith&#39; (*) (replicate 5 2) [1..]
[2,4,6,8,10]
ghci&gt; zipWith&#39; (zipWith&#39; (*)) [[1,2,3],[3,5,6],[2,3,4]] [[3,2,2],[3,4,5],[5,4,3]]
[[3,4,6],[9,20,30],[10,12,12]]</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, a single higher order function can be used in very
versatile ways. Imperative programming usually uses stuff like for
loops, while loops, setting something to a variable, checking its state,
etc. to achieve some behavior and then wrap it around an interface, like
a function. Functional programming uses higher order functions to
abstract away common patterns, like examining two lists in pairs and
doing something with those pairs or getting a set of solutions and
eliminating the ones you don’t need.</p>
<p>We’ll implement another function that’s already in the standard
library, called <code>flip</code>. Flip simply takes a function and
returns a function that is like our original function, only the first
two arguments are flipped. We can implement it like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>flip&#39; :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; c)
flip&#39; f = g
    where g x y = f y x</code></pre>
<p>Reading the type declaration, we say that it takes a function that
takes an <code>a</code> and a <code>b</code> and returns a function that
takes a <code>b</code> and an <code>a</code>. But because functions are
curried by default, the second pair of parentheses is really
unnecessary, because <code>-&gt;</code> is right associative by default.
<code>(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; c)</code> is the same
as <code>(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; (a -&gt; c))</code>, which
is the same as <code>(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c</code>.
We wrote that <code>g x y = f y x</code>. If that’s true, then
<code>f y x = g x y</code> must also hold, right? Keeping that in mind,
we can define this function in an even simpler manner.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>flip&#39; :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c
flip&#39; f y x = f x y</code></pre>
<p>Here, we take advantage of the fact that functions are curried. When
we call <code>flip' f</code> without the parameters <code>y</code> and
<code>x</code>, it will return an <code>f</code> that takes those two
parameters but calls them flipped. Even though flipped functions are
usually passed to other functions, we can take advantage of currying
when making higher-order functions by thinking ahead and writing what
their end result would be if they were called fully applied.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; flip&#39; zip [1,2,3,4,5] &quot;hello&quot;
[(&#39;h&#39;,1),(&#39;e&#39;,2),(&#39;l&#39;,3),(&#39;l&#39;,4),(&#39;o&#39;,5)]
ghci&gt; zipWith (flip&#39; div) [2,2..] [10,8,6,4,2]
[5,4,3,2,1]</code></pre>
<h2 id="maps-and-filters">Maps and filters</h2>
<p><code class="function label">map</code> takes a function and a list
and applies that function to every element in the list, producing a new
list. Let’s see what its type signature is and how it’s defined.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs</code></pre>
<p>The type signature says that it takes a function that takes an
<code>a</code> and returns a <code>b</code>, a list of <code>a</code>’s
and returns a list of <code>b</code>’s. It’s interesting that just by
looking at a function’s type signature, you can sometimes tell what it
does. <code>map</code> is one of those really versatile higher-order
functions that can be used in millions of different ways. Here it is in
action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; map (+3) [1,5,3,1,6]
[4,8,6,4,9]
ghci&gt; map (++ &quot;!&quot;) [&quot;BIFF&quot;, &quot;BANG&quot;, &quot;POW&quot;]
[&quot;BIFF!&quot;,&quot;BANG!&quot;,&quot;POW!&quot;]
ghci&gt; map (replicate 3) [3..6]
[[3,3,3],[4,4,4],[5,5,5],[6,6,6]]
ghci&gt; map (map (^2)) [[1,2],[3,4,5,6],[7,8]]
[[1,4],[9,16,25,36],[49,64]]
ghci&gt; map fst [(1,2),(3,5),(6,3),(2,6),(2,5)]
[1,3,6,2,2]</code></pre>
<p>You’ve probably noticed that each of these could be achieved with a
list comprehension. <code>map (+3) [1,5,3,1,6]</code> is the same as
writing <code>[x+3 | x &lt;- [1,5,3,1,6]]</code>. However, using
<code>map</code> is much more readable for cases where you only apply
some function to the elements of a list, especially once you’re dealing
with maps of maps and then the whole thing with a lot of brackets can
get a bit messy.</p>
<p><code class="label function">filter</code> is a function that takes a
predicate (a predicate is a function that tells whether something is
true or not, so in our case, a function that returns a boolean value)
and a list and then returns the list of elements that satisfy the
predicate. The type signature and implementation go like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
filter _ [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x       = x : filter p xs
    | otherwise = filter p xs</code></pre>
<p>Pretty simple stuff. If <code>p x</code> evaluates to
<code>True</code>, the element gets included in the new list. If it
doesn’t, it stays out. Some usage examples:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; filter (&gt;3) [1,5,3,2,1,6,4,3,2,1]
[5,6,4]
ghci&gt; filter (==3) [1,2,3,4,5]
[3]
ghci&gt; filter even [1..10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
ghci&gt; let notNull x = not (null x) in filter notNull [[1,2,3],[],[3,4,5],[2,2],[],[],[]]
[[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[2,2]]
ghci&gt; filter (`elem` [&#39;a&#39;..&#39;z&#39;]) &quot;u LaUgH aT mE BeCaUsE I aM diFfeRent&quot;
&quot;uagameasadifeent&quot;
ghci&gt; filter (`elem` [&#39;A&#39;..&#39;Z&#39;]) &quot;i Laugh At you Because u R All The Same&quot;
&quot;LABRATS&quot;</code></pre>
<p>All of this could also be achieved with list comprehensions by the
use of predicates. There’s no set rule for when to use <code>map</code>
and <code>filter</code> versus using list comprehension, you just have
to decide what’s more readable depending on the code and the context.
The <code>filter</code> equivalent of applying several predicates in a
list comprehension is either filtering something several times or
joining the predicates with the logical <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
function.</p>
<p>Remember our quicksort function from the <a
href="recursion.html">previous chapter</a>? We used list comprehensions
to filter out the list elements that are smaller than (or equal to) and
larger than the pivot. We can achieve the same functionality in a more
readable way by using <code>filter</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>quicksort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) =
    let smallerSorted = quicksort (filter (&lt;=x) xs)
        biggerSorted = quicksort (filter (&gt;x) xs)
    in  smallerSorted ++ [x] ++ biggerSorted</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/map.png" class="left"
width="210" height="115" alt="map" /></p>
<p>Mapping and filtering is the bread and butter of every functional
programmer’s toolbox. Uh. It doesn’t matter if you do it with the
<code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> functions or list
comprehensions. Recall how we solved the problem of finding right
triangles with a certain circumference. With imperative programming, we
would have solved it by nesting three loops and then testing if the
current combination satisfies a right triangle and if it has the right
perimeter. If that’s the case, we would have printed it out to the
screen or something. In functional programming, that pattern is achieved
with mapping and filtering. You make a function that takes a value and
produces some result. We map that function over a list of values and
then we filter the resulting list out for the results that satisfy our
search. Thanks to Haskell’s laziness, even if you map something over a
list several times and filter it several times, it will only pass over
the list once.</p>
<p>Let’s <strong>find the largest number under 100,000 that’s divisible
by 3829</strong>. To do that, we’ll just filter a set of possibilities
in which we know the solution lies.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>largestDivisible :: (Integral a) =&gt; a
largestDivisible = head (filter p [100000,99999..])
    where p x = x `mod` 3829 == 0</code></pre>
<p>We first make a list of all numbers lower than 100,000, descending.
Then we filter it by our predicate and because the numbers are sorted in
a descending manner, the largest number that satisfies our predicate is
the first element of the filtered list. We didn’t even need to use a
finite list for our starting set. That’s laziness in action again.
Because we only end up using the head of the filtered list, it doesn’t
matter if the filtered list is finite or infinite. The evaluation stops
when the first adequate solution is found.</p>
<p>Next up, we’re going to <strong>find the sum of all odd squares that
are smaller than 10,000</strong>. But first, because we’ll be using it
in our solution, we’re going to introduce the <code
class="label function">takeWhile</code> function. It takes a predicate
and a list and then goes from the beginning of the list and returns its
elements while the predicate holds true. Once an element is found for
which the predicate doesn’t hold, it stops. If we wanted to get the
first word of the string <code>"elephants know how to party"</code>, we
could do <code>takeWhile (/=' ') "elephants know how to party"</code>
and it would return <code>"elephants"</code>. Okay. The sum of all odd
squares that are smaller than 10,000. First, we’ll begin by mapping the
<code>(^2)</code> function to the infinite list <code>[1..]</code>. Then
we filter them so we only get the odd ones. And then, we’ll take
elements from that list while they are smaller than 10,000. Finally,
we’ll get the sum of that list. We don’t even have to define a function
for that, we can do it in one line in GHCI:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; sum (takeWhile (&lt;10000) (filter odd (map (^2) [1..])))
166650</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! We start with some initial data (the infinite list of all
natural numbers) and then we map over it, filter it and cut it until it
suits our needs and then we just sum it up. We could have also written
this using list comprehensions:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; sum (takeWhile (&lt;10000) [n^2 | n &lt;- [1..], odd (n^2)])
166650</code></pre>
<p>It’s a matter of taste as to which one you find prettier. Again,
Haskell’s property of laziness is what makes this possible. We can map
over and filter an infinite list, because it won’t actually map and
filter it right away, it’ll delay those actions. Only when we force
Haskell to show us the sum does the <code>sum</code> function say to the
<code>takeWhile</code> that it needs those numbers.
<code>takeWhile</code> forces the filtering and mapping to occur, but
only until a number greater than or equal to 10,000 is encountered.</p>
<p>For our next problem, we’ll be dealing with Collatz sequences. We
take a natural number. If that number is even, we divide it by two. If
it’s odd, we multiply it by 3 and then add 1 to that. We take the
resulting number and apply the same thing to it, which produces a new
number and so on. In essence, we get a chain of numbers. It is thought
that for all starting numbers, the chains finish at the number 1. So if
we take the starting number 13, we get this sequence: <em>13, 40, 20,
10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</em>. 13*3 + 1 equals 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20,
etc. We see that the chain has 10 terms.</p>
<p>Now what we want to know is this: <strong>for all starting numbers
between 1 and 100, how many chains have a length greater than
15?</strong> First off, we’ll write a function that produces a
chain:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>chain :: (Integral a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a]
chain 1 = [1]
chain n
    | even n =  n:chain (n `div` 2)
    | odd n  =  n:chain (n*3 + 1)</code></pre>
<p>Because the chains end at 1, that’s the edge case. This is a pretty
standard recursive function.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; chain 10
[10,5,16,8,4,2,1]
ghci&gt; chain 1
[1]
ghci&gt; chain 30
[30,15,46,23,70,35,106,53,160,80,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1]</code></pre>
<p>Yay! It seems to be working correctly. And now, the function that
tells us the answer to our question:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>numLongChains :: Int
numLongChains = length (filter isLong (map chain [1..100]))
    where isLong xs = length xs &gt; 15</code></pre>
<p>We map the <code>chain</code> function to <code>[1..100]</code> to
get a list of chains, which are themselves represented as lists. Then,
we filter them by a predicate that just checks whether a list’s length
is longer than 15. Once we’ve done the filtering, we see how many chains
are left in the resulting list.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This function has a type of
<code>numLongChains :: Int</code> because <code>length</code> returns an
<code>Int</code> instead of a <code>Num a</code> for historical reasons.
If we wanted to return a more general <code>Num a</code>, we could have
used <code>fromIntegral</code> on the resulting length.</p>
</div>
<p>Using <code>map</code>, we can also do stuff like
<code>map (*) [0..]</code>, if not for any other reason than to
illustrate how currying works and how (partially applied) functions are
real values that you can pass around to other functions or put into
lists (you just can’t turn them to strings). So far, we’ve only mapped
functions that take one parameter over lists, like
<code>map (*2) [0..]</code> to get a list of type
<code>(Num a) =&gt; [a]</code>, but we can also do
<code>map (*) [0..]</code> without a problem. What happens here is that
the number in the list is applied to the function <code>*</code>, which
has a type of <code>(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>. Applying
only one parameter to a function that takes two parameters returns a
function that takes one parameter. If we map <code>*</code> over the
list <code>[0..]</code>, we get back a list of functions that only take
one parameter, so <code>(Num a) =&gt; [a -&gt; a]</code>.
<code>map (*) [0..]</code> produces a list like the one we’d get by
writing <code>[(0*),(1*),(2*),(3*),(4*),(5*)..</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let listOfFuns = map (*) [0..]
ghci&gt; (listOfFuns !! 4) 5
20</code></pre>
<p>Getting the element with the index <code>4</code> from our list
returns a function that’s equivalent to <code>(4*)</code>. And then, we
just apply <code>5</code> to that function. So that’s like writing
<code>(4*) 5</code> or just <code>4 * 5</code>.</p>
<h2 id="lambdas">Lambdas</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/lambda.png"
class="right" width="203" height="230" alt="lambda" /></p>
<p>Lambdas are basically anonymous functions that are used because we
need some functions only once. Normally, we make a lambda with the sole
purpose of passing it to a higher-order function. To make a lambda, we
write a <code>\</code> (because it kind of looks like the greek letter
lambda if you squint hard enough) and then we write the parameters,
separated by spaces. After that comes a <code>-&gt;</code> and then the
function body. We usually surround them by parentheses, because
otherwise they extend all the way to the right.</p>
<p>If you look about 5 inches up, you’ll see that we used a
<em>where</em> binding in our <code>numLongChains</code> function to
make the <code>isLong</code> function for the sole purpose of passing it
to <code>filter</code>. Well, instead of doing that, we can use a
lambda:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>numLongChains :: Int
numLongChains = length (filter (\xs -&gt; length xs &gt; 15) (map chain [1..100]))</code></pre>
<p>Lambdas are expressions, that’s why we can just pass them like that.
The expression <code>(\xs -&gt; length xs &gt; 15)</code> returns a
function that tells us whether the length of the list passed to it is
greater than 15.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/lamb.png" class="left"
width="200" height="134" alt="lamb" /></p>
<p>People who are not well acquainted with how currying and partial
application works often use lambdas where they don’t need to. For
instance, the expressions <code>map (+3) [1,6,3,2]</code> and
<code>map (\x -&gt; x + 3) [1,6,3,2]</code> are equivalent since both
<code>(+3)</code> and <code>(\x -&gt; x + 3)</code> are functions that
take a number and add 3 to it. Needless to say, making a lambda in this
case is stupid since using partial application is much more
readable.</p>
<p>Like normal functions, lambdas can take any number of parameters:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; zipWith (\a b -&gt; (a * 30 + 3) / b) [5,4,3,2,1] [1,2,3,4,5]
[153.0,61.5,31.0,15.75,6.6]</code></pre>
<p>And like normal functions, you can pattern match in lambdas. The only
difference is that you can’t define several patterns for one parameter,
like making a <code>[]</code> and a <code>(x:xs)</code> pattern for the
same parameter and then having values fall through. If a pattern
matching fails in a lambda, a runtime error occurs, so be careful when
pattern matching in lambdas!</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; map (\(a,b) -&gt; a + b) [(1,2),(3,5),(6,3),(2,6),(2,5)]
[3,8,9,8,7]</code></pre>
<p>Lambdas are normally surrounded by parentheses unless we mean for
them to extend all the way to the right. Here’s something interesting:
due to the way functions are curried by default, these two are
equivalent:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>addThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
addThree x y z = x + y + z</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>addThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
addThree = \x -&gt; \y -&gt; \z -&gt; x + y + z</code></pre>
<p>If we define a function like this, it’s obvious why the type
declaration is what it is. There are three <code>-&gt;</code>’s in both
the type declaration and the equation. But of course, the first way to
write functions is far more readable, the second one is pretty much a
gimmick to illustrate currying.</p>
<p>However, there are times when using this notation is cool. I think
that the <code>flip</code> function is the most readable when defined
like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>flip&#39; :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c
flip&#39; f = \x y -&gt; f y x</code></pre>
<p>Even though that’s the same as writing
<code>flip' f x y = f y x</code>, we make it obvious that this will be
used for producing a new function most of the time. The most common use
case with <code>flip</code> is calling it with just the function
parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a
filter. So use lambdas in this way when you want to make it explicit
that your function is mainly meant to be partially applied and passed on
to a function as a parameter.</p>
<h2 id="folds">Only folds and horses</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/origami.png"
class="right" width="220" height="221" alt="folded bird" /></p>
<p>Back when we were dealing with recursion, we noticed a theme
throughout many of the recursive functions that operated on lists.
Usually, we’d have an edge case for the empty list. We’d introduce the
<code>x:xs</code> pattern and then we’d do some action that involves a
single element and the rest of the list. It turns out this is a very
common pattern, so a couple of very useful functions were introduced to
encapsulate it. These functions are called folds. They’re sort of like
the <code>map</code> function, only they reduce the list to some single
value.</p>
<p>A fold takes a binary function, a starting value (I like to call it
the accumulator) and a list to fold up. The binary function itself takes
two parameters. The binary function is called with the accumulator and
the first (or last) element and produces a new accumulator. Then, the
binary function is called again with the new accumulator and the now new
first (or last) element, and so on. Once we’ve walked over the whole
list, only the accumulator remains, which is what we’ve reduced the list
to.</p>
<p>First let’s take a look at the <code
class="label function">foldl</code> function, also called the left fold.
It folds the list up from the left side. The binary function is applied
between the starting value and the head of the list. That produces a new
accumulator value and the binary function is called with that value and
the next element, etc.</p>
<p>Let’s implement <code>sum</code> again, only this time, we’ll use a
fold instead of explicit recursion.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sum&#39; :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum&#39; xs = foldl (\acc x -&gt; acc + x) 0 xs</code></pre>
<p>Testing, one two three:</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; sum&#39; [3,5,2,1]
11</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/foldl.png"
class="left" width="172" height="348" alt="foldl" /></p>
<p>Let’s take an in-depth look into how this fold happens.
<code>\acc x -&gt; acc + x</code> is the binary function. <code>0</code>
is the starting value and <code>xs</code> is the list to be folded up.
Now first, <code>0</code> is used as the <code>acc</code> parameter to
the binary function and <code>3</code> is used as the <code>x</code> (or
the current element) parameter. <code>0 + 3</code> produces a
<code>3</code> and it becomes the new accumulator value, so to speak.
Next up, <code>3</code> is used as the accumulator value and
<code>5</code> as the current element and <code>8</code> becomes the new
accumulator value. Moving forward, <code>8</code> is the accumulator
value, <code>2</code> is the current element, the new accumulator value
is <code>10</code>. Finally, that <code>10</code> is used as the
accumulator value and <code>1</code> as the current element, producing
an <code>11</code>. Congratulations, you’ve done a fold!</p>
<p>This professional diagram on the left illustrates how a fold happens,
step by step (day by day!). The greenish brown number is the accumulator
value. You can see how the list is sort of consumed up from the left
side by the accumulator. Om nom nom nom! If we take into account that
functions are curried, we can write this implementation ever more
succinctly, like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sum&#39; :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum&#39; = foldl (+) 0</code></pre>
<p>The lambda function <code>(\acc x -&gt; acc + x)</code> is the same
as <code>(+)</code>. We can omit the <code>xs</code> as the parameter
because calling <code>foldl (+) 0</code> will return a function that
takes a list. Generally, if you have a function like
<code>foo a = bar b a</code>, you can rewrite it as
<code>foo = bar b</code>, because of currying.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, let’s implement another function with a left fold before
moving on to right folds. I’m sure you all know that <code>elem</code>
checks whether a value is part of a list so I won’t go into that again
(whoops, just did!). Let’s implement it with a left fold.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>elem&#39; :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
elem&#39; y ys = foldl (\acc x -&gt; if x == y then True else acc) False ys</code></pre>
<p>Well, well, well, what do we have here? The starting value and
accumulator here is a boolean value. The type of the accumulator value
and the end result is always the same when dealing with folds. Remember
that if you ever don’t know what to use as a starting value, it’ll give
you some idea. We start off with <code>False</code>. It makes sense to
use <code>False</code> as a starting value. We assume it isn’t there.
Also, if we call a fold on an empty list, the result will just be the
starting value. Then we check the current element is the element we’re
looking for. If it is, we set the accumulator to <code>True</code>. If
it’s not, we just leave the accumulator unchanged. If it was
<code>False</code> before, it stays that way because this current
element is not it. If it was <code>True</code>, we leave it at that.</p>
<p>The right fold, <code class="function label">foldr</code> works in a
similar way to the left fold, only the accumulator eats up the values
from the right. Also, the left fold’s binary function has the
accumulator as the first parameter and the current value as the second
one (so <code>\acc x -&gt; ...</code>), the right fold’s binary function
has the current value as the first parameter and the accumulator as the
second one (so <code>\x acc -&gt; ...</code>). It kind of makes sense
that the right fold has the accumulator on the right, because it folds
from the right side.</p>
<p>The accumulator value (and hence, the result) of a fold can be of any
type. It can be a number, a boolean or even a new list. We’ll be
implementing the map function with a right fold. The accumulator will be
a list, we’ll be accumulating the mapped list element by element. From
that, it’s obvious that the starting element will be an empty list.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>map&#39; :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map&#39; f xs = foldr (\x acc -&gt; f x : acc) [] xs</code></pre>
<p>If we’re mapping <code>(+3)</code> to <code>[1,2,3]</code>, we
approach the list from the right side. We take the last element, which
is <code>3</code> and apply the function to it, which ends up being
<code>6</code>. Then, we prepend it to the accumulator, which is
<code>[]</code>. <code>6:[]</code> is <code>[6]</code> and that’s now
the accumulator. We apply <code>(+3)</code> to <code>2</code>, that’s
<code>5</code> and we prepend (<code>:</code>) it to the accumulator, so
the accumulator is now <code>[5,6]</code>. We apply <code>(+3)</code> to
<code>1</code> and prepend that to the accumulator and so the end value
is <code>[4,5,6]</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could have implemented this function with a left fold
too. It would be
<code>map' f xs = foldl (\acc x -&gt; acc ++ [f x]) [] xs</code>, but
the thing is that the <code>++</code> function is much more expensive
than <code>:</code>, so we usually use right folds when we’re building
up new lists from a list.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/washmachine.png"
class="right" width="250" height="205" alt="fold this up!" /></p>
<p>If you reverse a list, you can do a right fold on it just like you
would have done a left fold and vice versa. Sometimes you don’t even
have to do that. The <code>sum</code> function can be implemented pretty
much the same with a left and right fold. One big difference is that
right folds work on infinite lists, whereas left ones don’t! To put it
plainly, if you take an infinite list at some point and you fold it up
from the right, you’ll eventually reach the beginning of the list.
However, if you take an infinite list at a point and you try to fold it
up from the left, you’ll never reach an end!</p>
<p><strong>Folds can be used to implement any function where you
traverse a list once, element by element, and then return something
based on that. Whenever you want to traverse a list to return something,
chances are you want a fold.</strong> That’s why folds are, along with
maps and filters, one of the most useful types of functions in
functional programming.</p>
<p>The <code class="label function">foldl1</code> and <code
class="label function">foldr1</code> functions work much like
<code>foldl</code> and <code>foldr</code>, only you don’t need to
provide them with an explicit starting value. They assume the first (or
last) element of the list to be the starting value and then start the
fold with the element next to it. With that in mind, the
<code>sum</code> function can be implemented like so:
<code>sum = foldl1 (+)</code>. Because they depend on the lists they
fold up having at least one element, they cause runtime errors if called
with empty lists. <code>foldl</code> and <code>foldr</code>, on the
other hand, work fine with empty lists. When making a fold, think about
how it acts on an empty list. If the function doesn’t make sense when
given an empty list, you can probably use a <code>foldl1</code> or
<code>foldr1</code> to implement it.</p>
<p>Just to show you how powerful folds are, we’re going to implement a
bunch of standard library functions by using folds:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>maximum&#39; :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
maximum&#39; = foldr1 (\x acc -&gt; if x &gt; acc then x else acc)

reverse&#39; :: [a] -&gt; [a]
reverse&#39; = foldl (\acc x -&gt; x : acc) []

product&#39; :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
product&#39; = foldr1 (*)

filter&#39; :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
filter&#39; p = foldr (\x acc -&gt; if p x then x : acc else acc) []

head&#39; :: [a] -&gt; a
head&#39; = foldr1 (\x _ -&gt; x)

last&#39; :: [a] -&gt; a
last&#39; = foldl1 (\_ x -&gt; x)</code></pre>
<p><code>head</code> is better implemented by pattern matching, but this
just goes to show, you can still achieve it by using folds. Our
<code>reverse'</code> definition is pretty clever, I think. We take a
starting value of an empty list and then approach our list from the left
and just prepend to our accumulator. In the end, we build up a reversed
list. <code>\acc x -&gt; x : acc</code> kind of looks like the
<code>:</code> function, only the parameters are flipped. That’s why we
could have also written our reverse as
<code>foldl (flip (:)) []</code>.</p>
<p>Another way to picture right and left folds is like this: say we have
a right fold and the binary function is <code>f</code> and the starting
value is <code>z</code>. If we’re right folding over the list
<code>[3,4,5,6]</code>, we’re essentially doing this:
<code>f 3 (f 4 (f 5 (f 6 z)))</code>. <code>f</code> is called with the
last element in the list and the accumulator, that value is given as the
accumulator to the next to last value and so on. If we take
<code>f</code> to be <code>+</code> and the starting accumulator value
to be <code>0</code>, that’s <code>3 + (4 + (5 + (6 + 0)))</code>. Or if
we write <code>+</code> as a prefix function, that’s
<code>(+) 3 ((+) 4 ((+) 5 ((+) 6 0)))</code>. Similarly, doing a left
fold over that list with <code>g</code> as the binary function and
<code>z</code> as the accumulator is the equivalent of
<code>g (g (g (g z 3) 4) 5) 6</code>. If we use <code>flip (:)</code> as
the binary function and <code>[]</code> as the accumulator (so we’re
reversing the list), then that’s the equivalent of
<code>flip (:) (flip (:) (flip (:) (flip (:) [] 3) 4) 5) 6</code>. And
sure enough, if you evaluate that expression, you get
<code>[6,5,4,3]</code>.</p>
<p><code class="function label">scanl</code> and <code
class="function label">scanr</code> are like <code>foldl</code> and
<code>foldr</code>, only they report all the intermediate accumulator
states in the form of a list. There are also <code>scanl1</code> and
<code>scanr1</code>, which are analogous to <code>foldl1</code> and
<code>foldr1</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; scanl (+) 0 [3,5,2,1]
[0,3,8,10,11]
ghci&gt; scanr (+) 0 [3,5,2,1]
[11,8,3,1,0]
ghci&gt; scanl1 (\acc x -&gt; if x &gt; acc then x else acc) [3,4,5,3,7,9,2,1]
[3,4,5,5,7,9,9,9]
ghci&gt; scanl (flip (:)) [] [3,2,1]
[[],[3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]</code></pre>
<p>When using a <code>scanl</code>, the final result will be in the last
element of the resulting list while a <code>scanr</code> will place the
result in the head.</p>
<p>Scans are used to monitor the progression of a function that can be
implemented as a fold. Let’s answer us this question: <strong>How many
elements does it take for the sum of the roots of all natural numbers to
exceed 1000?</strong> To get the squares of all natural numbers, we just
do <code>map sqrt [1..]</code>. Now, to get the sum, we could do a fold,
but because we’re interested in how the sum progresses, we’re going to
do a scan. Once we’ve done the scan, we just see how many sums are under
1000. The first sum in the scanlist will be 1, normally. The second will
be 1 plus the square root of 2. The third will be that plus the square
root of 3. If there are X sums under 1000, then it takes X+1 elements
for the sum to exceed 1000.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sqrtSums :: Int
sqrtSums = length (takeWhile (&lt;1000) (scanl1 (+) (map sqrt [1..]))) + 1</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; sqrtSums
131
ghci&gt; sum (map sqrt [1..131])
1005.0942035344083
ghci&gt; sum (map sqrt [1..130])
993.6486803921487</code></pre>
<p>We use <code>takeWhile</code> here instead of <code>filter</code>
because <code>filter</code> doesn’t work on infinite lists. Even though
we know the list is ascending, <code>filter</code> doesn’t, so we use
<code>takeWhile</code> to cut the scanlist off at the first occurrence
of a sum greater than 1000.</p>
<h2 id="function-application">Function application with $</h2>
<p>Alright, next up, we’ll take a look at the <code>$</code> function,
also called <em>function application</em>. First of all, let’s check out
how it’s defined:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>($) :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; b
f $ x = f x</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/dollar.png"
class="left" width="180" height="136" alt="dollar" /></p>
<p>What the heck? What is this useless operator? It’s just function
application! Well, almost, but not quite! Whereas normal function
application (putting a space between two things) has a really high
precedence, the <code>$</code> function has the lowest precedence.
Function application with a space is left-associative (so
<code>f a b c</code> is the same as <code>((f a) b) c)</code>), function
application with <code>$</code> is right-associative.</p>
<p>That’s all very well, but how does this help us? Most of the time,
it’s a convenience function so that we don’t have to write so many
parentheses. Consider the expression
<code>sum (map sqrt [1..130])</code>. Because <code>$</code> has such a
low precedence, we can rewrite that expression as
<code>sum $ map sqrt [1..130]</code>, saving ourselves precious
keystrokes! When a <code>$</code> is encountered, the expression on its
right is applied as the parameter to the function on its left. How about
<code>sqrt 3 + 4 + 9</code>? This adds together 9, 4 and the square root
of 3. If we want to get the square root of <em>3 + 4 + 9</em>, we’d have
to write <code>sqrt (3 + 4 + 9)</code> or if we use <code>$</code> we
can write it as <code>sqrt $ 3 + 4 + 9</code> because <code>$</code> has
the lowest precedence of any operator. That’s why you can imagine a
<code>$</code> being sort of the equivalent of writing an opening
parenthesis and then writing a closing one on the far right side of the
expression.</p>
<p>How about <code>sum (filter (&gt; 10) (map (*2) [2..10]))</code>?
Well, because <code>$</code> is right-associative,
<code>f (g (z x))</code> is equal to <code>f $ g $ z x</code>. And so,
we can rewrite <code>sum (filter (&gt; 10) (map (*2) [2..10]))</code> as
<code>sum $ filter (&gt; 10) $ map (*2) [2..10]</code>.</p>
<p>But apart from getting rid of parentheses, <code>$</code> means that
function application can be treated just like another function. That
way, we can, for instance, map function application over a list of
functions.</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; map ($ 3) [(4+), (10*), (^2), sqrt]
[7.0,30.0,9.0,1.7320508075688772]</code></pre>
<h2 id="composition">Function composition</h2>
<p>In mathematics, function composition is defined like this: <img
src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/composition.png"
alt="(f . g)(x) = f(g(x))" />, meaning that composing two functions
produces a new function that, when called with a parameter, say,
<em>x</em> is the equivalent of calling <em>g</em> with the parameter
<em>x</em> and then calling the <em>f</em> with that result.</p>
<p>In Haskell, function composition is pretty much the same thing. We do
function composition with the <code>.</code> function, which is defined
like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; c
f . g = \x -&gt; f (g x)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/higher-order-functions/notes.png"
class="left" width="230" height="198" alt="notes" /></p>
<p>Mind the type declaration. <code>f</code> must take as its parameter
a value that has the same type as <code>g</code>’s return value. So the
resulting function takes a parameter of the same type that
<code>g</code> takes and returns a value of the same type that
<code>f</code> returns. The expression <code>negate . (* 3)</code>
returns a function that takes a number, multiplies it by 3 and then
negates it.</p>
<p>One of the uses for function composition is making functions on the
fly to pass to other functions. Sure, can use lambdas for that, but many
times, function composition is clearer and more concise. Say we have a
list of numbers and we want to turn them all into negative numbers. One
way to do that would be to get each number’s absolute value and then
negate it, like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; map (\x -&gt; negate (abs x)) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]
[-5,-3,-6,-7,-3,-2,-19,-24]</code></pre>
<p>Notice the lambda and how it looks like the result function
composition. Using function composition, we can rewrite that as:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; map (negate . abs) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]
[-5,-3,-6,-7,-3,-2,-19,-24]</code></pre>
<p>Fabulous! Function composition is right-associative, so we can
compose many functions at a time. The expression
<code>f (g (z x))</code> is equivalent to <code>(f . g . z) x</code>.
With that in mind, we can turn</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; map (\xs -&gt; negate (sum (tail xs))) [[1..5],[3..6],[1..7]]
[-14,-15,-27]</code></pre>
<p>into</p>
<pre class="haskell:ghci"><code>ghci&gt; map (negate . sum . tail) [[1..5],[3..6],[1..7]]
[-14,-15,-27]</code></pre>
<p>But what about functions that take several parameters? Well, if we
want to use them in function composition, we usually have to partially
apply them just so much that each function takes just one parameter.
<code>sum (replicate 5 (max 6.7 8.9))</code> can be rewritten as
<code>(sum . replicate 5 . max 6.7) 8.9</code> or as
<code>sum . replicate 5 . max 6.7 $ 8.9</code>. What goes on in here is
this: a function that takes what <code>max 6.7</code> takes and applies
<code>replicate 5</code> to it is created. Then, a function that takes
the result of that and does a sum of it is created. Finally, that
function is called with <code>8.9</code>. But normally, you just read
that as: apply <code>8.9</code> to <code>max 6.7</code>, then apply
<code>replicate 5</code> to that and then apply <code>sum</code> to
that. If you want to rewrite an expression with a lot of parentheses by
using function composition, you can start by putting the last parameter
of the innermost function after a <code>$</code> and then just composing
all the other function calls, writing them without their last parameter
and putting dots between them. If you have
<code>replicate 100 (product (map (*3) (zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] [4,5,6,7,8])))</code>,
you can write it as
<code>replicate 100 . product . map (*3) . zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] $ [4,5,6,7,8]</code>.
If the expression ends with three parentheses, chances are that if you
translate it into function composition, it’ll have three composition
operators.</p>
<p>Another common use of function composition is defining functions in
the so-called point free style (also called the point<em>less</em>
style). Take for example this function that we wrote earlier:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sum&#39; :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum&#39; xs = foldl (+) 0 xs</code></pre>
<p>The <code>xs</code> is exposed on both right sides. Because of
currying, we can omit the <code>xs</code> on both sides, because calling
<code>foldl (+) 0</code> creates a function that takes a list. Writing
the function as <code>sum' = foldl (+) 0</code> is called writing it in
point free style. How would we write this in point free style?</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fn x = ceiling (negate (tan (cos (max 50 x))))</code></pre>
<p>We can’t just get rid of the <code>x</code> on both right sides. The
<code>x</code> in the function body has parentheses after it.
<code>cos (max 50)</code> wouldn’t make sense. You can’t get the cosine
of a function. What we can do is express <code>fn</code> as a
composition of functions.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fn = ceiling . negate . tan . cos . max 50</code></pre>
<p>Excellent! Many times, a point free style is more readable and
concise, because it makes you think about functions and what kind of
functions composing them results in instead of thinking about data and
how it’s shuffled around. You can take simple functions and use
composition as glue to form more complex functions. However, many times,
writing a function in point free style can be less readable if a
function is too complex. That’s why making long chains of function
composition is discouraged, although I plead guilty of sometimes being
too composition-happy. The preferred style is to use <em>let</em>
bindings to give labels to intermediary results or split the problem
into sub-problems and then put it together so that the function makes
sense to someone reading it instead of just making a huge composition
chain.</p>
<p>In the section about maps and filters, we solved a problem of finding
the sum of all odd squares that are smaller than 10,000. Here’s what the
solution looks like when put into a function.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>oddSquareSum :: Integer
oddSquareSum = sum (takeWhile (&lt;10000) (filter odd (map (^2) [1..])))</code></pre>
<p>Being such a fan of function composition, I would have probably
written that like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>oddSquareSum :: Integer
oddSquareSum = sum . takeWhile (&lt;10000) . filter odd . map (^2) $ [1..]</code></pre>
<p>However, if there was a chance of someone else reading that code, I
would have written it like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>oddSquareSum :: Integer
oddSquareSum =
    let oddSquares = filter odd $ map (^2) [1..]
        belowLimit = takeWhile (&lt;10000) oddSquares
    in  sum belowLimit</code></pre>
<p>It wouldn’t win any code golf competition, but someone reading the
function will probably find it easier to read than a composition
chain.</p>
