<h1 id="making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses">Making Our Own Types and
Typeclasses</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters, we covered some existing Haskell types and
typeclasses. In this chapter, we’ll learn how to make our own and how to
put them to work!</p>
<h2 id="algebraic-data-types">Algebraic data types intro</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve run into a lot of data types. <code>Bool</code>,
<code>Int</code>, <code>Char</code>, <code>Maybe</code>, etc. But how do
we make our own? Well, one way is to use the <strong>data</strong>
keyword to define a type. Let’s see how the <code>Bool</code> type is
defined in the standard library.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Bool = False | True</code></pre>
<p><code>data</code> means that we’re defining a new data type. The part
before the <code>=</code> denotes the type, which is <code>Bool</code>.
The parts after the <code>=</code> are <strong>value
constructors</strong>. They specify the different values that this type
can have. The <code>|</code> is read as <em>or</em>. So we can read this
as: the <code>Bool</code> type can have a value of <code>True</code> or
<code>False</code>. Both the type name and the value constructors have
to be capital cased.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, we can think of the <code>Int</code> type as
being defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Int = -2147483648 | -2147483647 | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ... | 2147483647</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/caveman.png"
class="left" width="220" height="215" alt="caveman" /></p>
<p>The first and last value constructors are the minimum and maximum
possible values of <code>Int</code>. It’s not actually defined like
this, the ellipses are here because we omitted a heapload of numbers, so
this is just for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p>Now, let’s think about how we would represent a shape in Haskell. One
way would be to use tuples. A circle could be denoted as
<code>(43.1, 55.0, 10.4)</code> where the first and second fields are
the coordinates of the circle’s center and the third field is the
radius. Sounds OK, but those could also represent a 3D vector or
anything else. A better solution would be to make our own type to
represent a shape. Let’s say that a shape can be a circle or a
rectangle. Here it is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float</code></pre>
<p>Now what’s this? Think of it like this. The <code>Circle</code> value
constructor has three fields, which take floats. So when we write a
value constructor, we can optionally add some types after it and those
types define the values it will contain. Here, the first two fields are
the coordinates of its center, the third one its radius. The
<code>Rectangle</code> value constructor has four fields which accept
floats. The first two are the coordinates to its upper left corner and
the second two are coordinates to its lower right one.</p>
<p>Now when I say fields, I actually mean parameters. Value constructors
are actually functions that ultimately return a value of a data type.
Let’s take a look at the type signatures for these two value
constructors.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t Circle
Circle :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
ghci&gt; :t Rectangle
Rectangle :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape</code></pre>
<p>Cool, so value constructors are functions like everything else. Who
would have thought? Let’s make a function that takes a shape and returns
its surface.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>surface :: Shape -&gt; Float
surface (Circle _ _ r) = pi * r ^ 2
surface (Rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2) = (abs $ x2 - x1) * (abs $ y2 - y1)</code></pre>
<p>The first notable thing here is the type declaration. It says that
the function takes a shape and returns a float. We couldn’t write a type
declaration of <code>Circle -&gt; Float</code> because
<code>Circle</code> is not a type, <code>Shape</code> is. Just like we
can’t write a function with a type declaration of
<code>True -&gt; Int</code>. The next thing we notice here is that we
can pattern match against constructors. We pattern matched against
constructors before (all the time actually) when we pattern matched
against values like <code>[]</code> or <code>False</code> or
<code>5</code>, only those values didn’t have any fields. We just write
a constructor and then bind its fields to names. Because we’re
interested in the radius, we don’t actually care about the first two
fields, which tell us where the circle is.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; surface $ Circle 10 20 10
314.15927
ghci&gt; surface $ Rectangle 0 0 100 100
10000.0</code></pre>
<p>Yay, it works! But if we try to just print out
<code>Circle 10 20 5</code> in the prompt, we’ll get an error. That’s
because Haskell doesn’t know how to display our data type as a string
(yet). Remember, when we try to print a value out in the prompt, Haskell
first runs the <code>show</code> function to get the string
representation of our value and then it prints that out to the terminal.
To make our <code>Shape</code> type part of the <code>Show</code>
typeclass, we modify it like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>We won’t concern ourselves with deriving too much for now. Let’s just
say that if we add <code>deriving (Show)</code> at the end of a
<em>data</em> declaration, Haskell automagically makes that type part of
the <code>Show</code> typeclass. So now, we can do this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Circle 10 20 5
Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0
ghci&gt; Rectangle 50 230 60 90
Rectangle 50.0 230.0 60.0 90.0</code></pre>
<p>Value constructors are functions, so we can map them and partially
apply them and everything. If we want a list of concentric circles with
different radii, we can do this.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; map (Circle 10 20) [4,5,6,6]
[Circle 10.0 20.0 4.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 5.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0,Circle 10.0 20.0 6.0]</code></pre>
<p>Our data type is good, although it could be better. Let’s make an
intermediate data type that defines a point in two-dimensional space.
Then we can use that to make our shapes more understandable.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Point = Point Float Float deriving (Show)
data Shape = Circle Point Float | Rectangle Point Point deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that when defining a point, we used the same name for the data
type and the value constructor. This has no special meaning, although
it’s common to use the same name as the type if there’s only one value
constructor. So now the <code>Circle</code> has two fields, one is of
type <code>Point</code> and the other of type <code>Float</code>. This
makes it easier to understand what’s what. Same goes for the rectangle.
We have to adjust our <code>surface</code> function to reflect these
changes.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>surface :: Shape -&gt; Float
surface (Circle _ r) = pi * r ^ 2
surface (Rectangle (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) = (abs $ x2 - x1) * (abs $ y2 - y1)</code></pre>
<p>The only thing we had to change were the patterns. We disregarded the
whole point in the circle pattern. In the rectangle pattern, we just
used a nested pattern matching to get the fields of the points. If we
wanted to reference the points themselves for some reason, we could have
used as-patterns.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; surface (Rectangle (Point 0 0) (Point 100 100))
10000.0
ghci&gt; surface (Circle (Point 0 0) 24)
1809.5574</code></pre>
<p>How about a function that nudges a shape? It takes a shape, the
amount to move it on the x axis and the amount to move it on the y axis
and then returns a new shape that has the same dimensions, only it’s
located somewhere else.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>nudge :: Shape -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
nudge (Circle (Point x y) r) a b = Circle (Point (x+a) (y+b)) r
nudge (Rectangle (Point x1 y1) (Point x2 y2)) a b = Rectangle (Point (x1+a) (y1+b)) (Point (x2+a) (y2+b))</code></pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward. We add the nudge amounts to the points that
denote the position of the shape.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; nudge (Circle (Point 34 34) 10) 5 10
Circle (Point 39.0 44.0) 10.0</code></pre>
<p>If we don’t want to deal directly with points, we can make some
auxiliary functions that create shapes of some size at the zero
coordinates and then nudge those.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>baseCircle :: Float -&gt; Shape
baseCircle r = Circle (Point 0 0) r

baseRect :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Shape
baseRect width height = Rectangle (Point 0 0) (Point width height)</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; nudge (baseRect 40 100) 60 23
Rectangle (Point 60.0 23.0) (Point 100.0 123.0)</code></pre>
<p>You can, of course, export your data types in your modules. To do
that, just write your type along with the functions you are exporting
and then add some parentheses and in them specify the value constructors
that you want to export for it, separated by commas. If you want to
export all the value constructors for a given type, just write
<code>..</code>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to export the functions and types that we defined here
in a module, we could start it off like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>module Shapes
( Point(..)
, Shape(..)
, surface
, nudge
, baseCircle
, baseRect
) where</code></pre>
<p>By doing <code>Shape(..)</code>, we exported all the value
constructors for <code>Shape</code>, so that means that whoever imports
our module can make shapes by using the <code>Rectangle</code> and
<code>Circle</code> value constructors. It’s the same as writing
<code>Shape (Rectangle, Circle)</code>.</p>
<p>We could also opt not to export any value constructors for
<code>Shape</code> by just writing <code>Shape</code> in the export
statement. That way, someone importing our module could only make shapes
by using the auxiliary functions <code>baseCircle</code> and
<code>baseRect</code>. <code>Data.Map</code> uses that approach. You
can’t create a map by doing <code>Map.Map [(1,2),(3,4)]</code> because
it doesn’t export that value constructor. However, you can make a
mapping by using one of the auxiliary functions like
<code>Map.fromList</code>. Remember, value constructors are just
functions that take the fields as parameters and return a value of some
type (like <code>Shape</code>) as a result. So when we choose not to
export them, we just prevent the person importing our module from using
those functions, but if some other functions that are exported return a
type, we can use them to make values of our custom data types.</p>
<p>Not exporting the value constructors of a data types makes them more
abstract in such a way that we hide their implementation. Also, whoever
uses our module can’t pattern match against the value constructors.</p>
<h2 id="record-syntax">Record syntax</h2>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/record.png"
class="right" width="208" height="97" alt="record" /></p>
<p>OK, we’ve been tasked with creating a data type that describes a
person. The info that we want to store about that person is: first name,
last name, age, height, phone number, and favorite ice-cream flavor. I
don’t know about you, but that’s all I ever want to know about a person.
Let’s give it a go!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Person = Person String String Int Float String String deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>O-kay. The first field is the first name, the second is the last
name, the third is the age and so on. Let’s make a person.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let guy = Person &quot;Buddy&quot; &quot;Finklestein&quot; 43 184.2 &quot;526-2928&quot; &quot;Chocolate&quot;
ghci&gt; guy
Person &quot;Buddy&quot; &quot;Finklestein&quot; 43 184.2 &quot;526-2928&quot; &quot;Chocolate&quot;</code></pre>
<p>That’s kind of cool, although slightly unreadable. What if we want to
create a function to get separate info from a person? A function that
gets some person’s first name, a function that gets some person’s last
name, etc. Well, we’d have to define them kind of like this.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>firstName :: Person -&gt; String
firstName (Person firstname _ _ _ _ _) = firstname

lastName :: Person -&gt; String
lastName (Person _ lastname _ _ _ _) = lastname

age :: Person -&gt; Int
age (Person _ _ age _ _ _) = age

height :: Person -&gt; Float
height (Person _ _ _ height _ _) = height

phoneNumber :: Person -&gt; String
phoneNumber (Person _ _ _ _ number _) = number

flavor :: Person -&gt; String
flavor (Person _ _ _ _ _ flavor) = flavor</code></pre>
<p>Whew! I certainly did not enjoy writing that! Despite being very
cumbersome and BORING to write, this method works.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let guy = Person &quot;Buddy&quot; &quot;Finklestein&quot; 43 184.2 &quot;526-2928&quot; &quot;Chocolate&quot;
ghci&gt; firstName guy
&quot;Buddy&quot;
ghci&gt; height guy
184.2
ghci&gt; flavor guy
&quot;Chocolate&quot;</code></pre>
<p>There must be a better way, you say! Well no, there isn’t, sorry.</p>
<p>Just kidding, there is. Hahaha! The makers of Haskell were very smart
and anticipated this scenario. They included an alternative way to write
data types. Here’s how we could achieve the above functionality with
record syntax.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     , height :: Float
                     , phoneNumber :: String
                     , flavor :: String
                     } deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>So instead of just naming the field types one after another and
separating them with spaces, we use curly brackets. First we write the
name of the field, for instance, <code>firstName</code> and then we
write a double colon <code>::</code> (also called Paamayim Nekudotayim,
haha) and then we specify the type. The resulting data type is exactly
the same. The main benefit of this is that it creates functions that
lookup fields in the data type. By using record syntax to create this
data type, Haskell automatically made these functions:
<code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>age</code>,
<code>height</code>, <code>phoneNumber</code> and
<code>flavor</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t flavor
flavor :: Person -&gt; String
ghci&gt; :t firstName
firstName :: Person -&gt; String</code></pre>
<p>There’s another benefit to using record syntax. When we derive
<code>Show</code> for the type, it displays it differently if we use
record syntax to define and instantiate the type. Say we have a type
that represents a car. We want to keep track of the company that made
it, the model name and its year of production. Watch.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Car = Car String String Int deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; 1967
Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; 1967</code></pre>
<p>If we define it using record syntax, we can make a new car like
this.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Car = Car {company :: String, model :: String, year :: Int} deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Car {company=&quot;Ford&quot;, model=&quot;Mustang&quot;, year=1967}
Car {company = &quot;Ford&quot;, model = &quot;Mustang&quot;, year = 1967}</code></pre>
<p>When making a new car, we don’t have to necessarily put the fields in
the proper order, as long as we list all of them. But if we don’t use
record syntax, we have to specify them in order.</p>
<p>Use record syntax when a constructor has several fields and it’s not
obvious which field is which. If we make a 3D vector data type by doing
<code>data Vector = Vector Int Int Int</code>, it’s pretty obvious that
the fields are the components of a vector. However, in our
<code>Person</code> and <code>Car</code> types, it wasn’t so obvious and
we greatly benefited from using record syntax.</p>
<h2 id="type-parameters">Type parameters</h2>
<p>A value constructor can take some values parameters and then produce
a new value. For instance, the <code>Car</code> constructor takes three
values and produces a car value. In a similar manner, <strong>type
constructors</strong> can take types as parameters to produce new types.
This might sound a bit too meta at first, but it’s not that complicated.
If you’re familiar with templates in C++, you’ll see some parallels. To
get a clear picture of what type parameters work like in action, let’s
take a look at how a type we’ve already met is implemented.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/yeti.png"
class="left" width="209" height="260" alt="yeti" /></p>
<p>The <code>a</code> here is the type parameter. And because there’s a
type parameter involved, we call <code>Maybe</code> a type constructor.
Depending on what we want this data type to hold when it’s not
<code>Nothing</code>, this type constructor can end up producing a type
of <code>Maybe Int</code>, <code>Maybe Car</code>,
<code>Maybe String</code>, etc. No value can have a type of just
<code>Maybe</code>, because that’s not a type per se, it’s a type
constructor. In order for this to be a real type that a value can be
part of, it has to have all its type parameters filled up.</p>
<p>So if we pass <code>Char</code> as the type parameter to
<code>Maybe</code>, we get a type of <code>Maybe Char</code>. The value
<code>Just 'a'</code> has a type of <code>Maybe Char</code>, for
example.</p>
<p>You might not know it, but we used a type that has a type parameter
before we used <code>Maybe</code>. That type is the list type. Although
there’s some syntactic sugar in play, the list type takes a parameter to
produce a concrete type. Values can have an <code>[Int]</code> type, a
<code>[Char]</code> type, a <code>[[String]]</code> type, but you can’t
have a value that just has a type of <code>[]</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s play around with the <code>Maybe</code> type.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just &quot;Haha&quot;
Just &quot;Haha&quot;
ghci&gt; Just 84
Just 84
ghci&gt; :t Just &quot;Haha&quot;
Just &quot;Haha&quot; :: Maybe [Char]
ghci&gt; :t Just 84
Just 84 :: (Num t) =&gt; Maybe t
ghci&gt; :t Nothing
Nothing :: Maybe a
ghci&gt; Just 10 :: Maybe Double
Just 10.0</code></pre>
<p>Type parameters are useful because we can make different types with
them depending on what kind of types we want contained in our data type.
When we do <code>:t Just "Haha"</code>, the type inference engine
figures it out to be of the type <code>Maybe [Char]</code>, because if
the <code>a</code> in the <code>Just a</code> is a string, then the
<code>a</code> in <code>Maybe a</code> must also be a string.</p>
<p>Notice that the type of <code>Nothing</code> is <code>Maybe a</code>.
Its type is polymorphic. If some function requires a
<code>Maybe Int</code> as a parameter, we can give it a
<code>Nothing</code>, because a <code>Nothing</code> doesn’t contain a
value anyway and so it doesn’t matter. The <code>Maybe a</code> type can
act like a <code>Maybe Int</code> if it has to, just like <code>5</code>
can act like an <code>Int</code> or a <code>Double</code>. Similarly,
the type of the empty list is <code>[a]</code>. An empty list can act
like a list of anything. That’s why we can do <code>[1,2,3] ++ []</code>
and <code>["ha","ha","ha"] ++ []</code>.</p>
<p>Using type parameters is very beneficial, but only when using them
makes sense. Usually we use them when our data type would work
regardless of the type of the value it then holds inside it, like with
our <code>Maybe a</code> type. If our type acts as some kind of box,
it’s good to use them. We could change our <code>Car</code> data type
from this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Car = Car { company :: String
               , model :: String
               , year :: Int
               } deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Car a b c = Car { company :: a
                     , model :: b
                     , year :: c
                     } deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>But would we really benefit? The answer is: probably no, because we’d
just end up defining functions that only work on the
<code>Car String String Int</code> type. For instance, given our first
definition of <code>Car</code>, we could make a function that displays
the car’s properties in a nice little text.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>tellCar :: Car -&gt; String
tellCar (Car {company = c, model = m, year = y}) = &quot;This &quot; ++ c ++ &quot; &quot; ++ m ++ &quot; was made in &quot; ++ show y</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let stang = Car {company=&quot;Ford&quot;, model=&quot;Mustang&quot;, year=1967}
ghci&gt; tellCar stang
&quot;This Ford Mustang was made in 1967&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A cute little function! The type declaration is cute and it works
nicely. Now what if <code>Car</code> was <code>Car a b c</code>?</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>tellCar :: (Show a) =&gt; Car String String a -&gt; String
tellCar (Car {company = c, model = m, year = y}) = &quot;This &quot; ++ c ++ &quot; &quot; ++ m ++ &quot; was made in &quot; ++ show y</code></pre>
<p>We’d have to force this function to take a <code>Car</code> type of
<code>(Show a) =&gt; Car String String a</code>. You can see that the
type signature is more complicated and the only benefit we’d actually
get would be that we can use any type that’s an instance of the
<code>Show</code> typeclass as the type for <code>c</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; tellCar (Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; 1967)
&quot;This Ford Mustang was made in 1967&quot;
ghci&gt; tellCar (Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; &quot;nineteen sixty seven&quot;)
&quot;This Ford Mustang was made in \&quot;nineteen sixty seven\&quot;&quot;
ghci&gt; :t Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; 1967
Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; 1967 :: (Num t) =&gt; Car [Char] [Char] t
ghci&gt; :t Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; &quot;nineteen sixty seven&quot;
Car &quot;Ford&quot; &quot;Mustang&quot; &quot;nineteen sixty seven&quot; :: Car [Char] [Char] [Char]</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/meekrat.png"
class="right" width="150" height="267" alt="meekrat" /></p>
<p>In real life though, we’d end up using
<code>Car String String Int</code> most of the time and so it would seem
that parameterizing the <code>Car</code> type isn’t really worth it. We
usually use type parameters when the type that’s contained inside the
data type’s various value constructors isn’t really that important for
the type to work. A list of stuff is a list of stuff and it doesn’t
matter what the type of that stuff is, it can still work. If we want to
sum a list of numbers, we can specify later in the summing function that
we specifically want a list of numbers. Same goes for
<code>Maybe</code>. <code>Maybe</code> represents an option of either
having nothing or having one of something. It doesn’t matter what the
type of that something is.</p>
<p>Another example of a parameterized type that we’ve already met is
<code>Map k v</code> from <code>Data.Map</code>. The <code>k</code> is
the type of the keys in a map and the <code>v</code> is the type of the
values. This is a good example of where type parameters are very useful.
Having maps parameterized enables us to have mappings from any type to
any other type, as long as the type of the key is part of the
<code>Ord</code> typeclass. If we were defining a mapping type, we could
add a typeclass constraint in the <em>data</em> declaration:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data (Ord k) =&gt; Map k v = ...</code></pre>
<p>However, it’s a very strong convention in Haskell to <strong>never
add typeclass constraints in data declarations.</strong> Why? Well,
because we don’t benefit a lot, but we end up writing more class
constraints, even when we don’t need them. If we put or don’t put the
<code>Ord k</code> constraint in the <em>data</em> declaration for
<code>Map k v</code>, we’re going to have to put the constraint into
functions that assume the keys in a map can be ordered. But if we don’t
put the constraint in the data declaration, we don’t have to put
<code>(Ord k) =&gt;</code> in the type declarations of functions that
don’t care whether the keys can be ordered or not. An example of such a
function is <code>toList</code>, that just takes a mapping and converts
it to an associative list. Its type signature is
<code>toList :: Map k a -&gt; [(k, a)]</code>. If <code>Map k v</code>
had a type constraint in its <em>data</em> declaration, the type for
<code>toList</code> would have to be
<code>toList :: (Ord k) =&gt; Map k a -&gt; [(k, a)]</code>, even though
the function doesn’t do any comparing of keys by order.</p>
<p>So don’t put type constraints into <em>data</em> declarations even if
it seems to make sense, because you’ll have to put them into the
function type declarations either way.</p>
<p>Let’s implement a 3D vector type and add some operations for it.
We’ll be using a parameterized type because even though it will usually
contain numeric types, it will still support several of them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Vector a = Vector a a a deriving (Show)

vplus :: (Num t) =&gt; Vector t -&gt; Vector t -&gt; Vector t
(Vector i j k) `vplus` (Vector l m n) = Vector (i+l) (j+m) (k+n)

vectMult :: (Num t) =&gt; Vector t -&gt; t -&gt; Vector t
(Vector i j k) `vectMult` m = Vector (i*m) (j*m) (k*m)

scalarMult :: (Num t) =&gt; Vector t -&gt; Vector t -&gt; t
(Vector i j k) `scalarMult` (Vector l m n) = i*l + j*m + k*n</code></pre>
<p><code>vplus</code> is for adding two vectors together. Two vectors
are added just by adding their corresponding components.
<code>scalarMult</code> is for the scalar product of two vectors and
<code>vectMult</code> is for multiplying a vector with a scalar. These
functions can operate on types of <code>Vector Int</code>,
<code>Vector Integer</code>, <code>Vector Float</code>, whatever, as
long as the <code>a</code> from <code>Vector a</code> is from the
<code>Num</code> typeclass. Also, if you examine the type declaration
for these functions, you’ll see that they can operate only on vectors of
the same type and the numbers involved must also be of the type that is
contained in the vectors. Notice that we didn’t put a <code>Num</code>
class constraint in the <em>data</em> declaration, because we’d have to
repeat it in the functions anyway.</p>
<p>Once again, it’s very important to distinguish between the type
constructor and the value constructor. When declaring a data type, the
part before the <code>=</code> is the type constructor and the
constructors after it (possibly separated by <code>|</code>’s) are value
constructors. Giving a function a type of
<code>Vector t t t -&gt; Vector t t t -&gt; t</code> would be wrong,
because we have to put types in type declaration and the vector
<strong>type</strong> constructor takes only one parameter, whereas the
value constructor takes three. Let’s play around with our vectors.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Vector 3 5 8 `vplus` Vector 9 2 8
Vector 12 7 16
ghci&gt; Vector 3 5 8 `vplus` Vector 9 2 8 `vplus` Vector 0 2 3
Vector 12 9 19
ghci&gt; Vector 3 9 7 `vectMult` 10
Vector 30 90 70
ghci&gt; Vector 4 9 5 `scalarMult` Vector 9.0 2.0 4.0
74.0
ghci&gt; Vector 2 9 3 `vectMult` (Vector 4 9 5 `scalarMult` Vector 9 2 4)
Vector 148 666 222</code></pre>

<p>In the <a
href="types-and-typeclasses.html#typeclasses-101">Typeclasses 101</a>
section, we explained the basics of typeclasses. We explained that a
typeclass is a sort of an interface that defines some behavior. A type
can be made an <strong>instance</strong> of a typeclass if it supports
that behavior. Example: the <code>Int</code> type is an instance of the
<code>Eq</code> typeclass because the <code>Eq</code> typeclass defines
behavior for stuff that can be equated. And because integers can be
equated, <code>Int</code> is a part of the <code>Eq</code> typeclass.
The real usefulness comes with the functions that act as the interface
for <code>Eq</code>, namely <code>==</code> and <code>/=</code>. If a
type is a part of the <code>Eq</code> typeclass, we can use the
<code>==</code> functions with values of that type. That’s why
expressions like <code>4 == 4</code> and <code>"foo" /= "bar"</code>
typecheck.</p>
<p>We also mentioned that they’re often confused with classes in
languages like Java, Python, C++ and the like, which then baffles a lot
of people. In those languages, classes are a blueprint from which we
then create objects that contain state and can do some actions.
Typeclasses are more like interfaces. We don’t make data from
typeclasses. Instead, we first make our data type and then we think
about what it can act like. If it can act like something that can be
equated, we make it an instance of the <code>Eq</code> typeclass. If it
can act like something that can be ordered, we make it an instance of
the <code>Ord</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>In the next section, we’ll take a look at how we can manually make
our types instances of typeclasses by implementing the functions defined
by the typeclasses. But right now, let’s see how Haskell can
automatically make our type an instance of any of the following
typeclasses: <code>Eq</code>, <code>Ord</code>, <code>Enum</code>,
<code>Bounded</code>, <code>Show</code>, <code>Read</code>. Haskell can
derive the behavior of our types in these contexts if we use the
<em>deriving</em> keyword when making our data type.</p>
<p>Consider this data type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     }</code></pre>
<p>It describes a person. Let’s assume that no two people have the same
combination of first name, last name and age. Now, if we have records
for two people, does it make sense to see if they represent the same
person? Sure it does. We can try to equate them and see if they’re equal
or not. That’s why it would make sense for this type to be part of the
<code>Eq</code> typeclass. We’ll derive the instance.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     } deriving (Eq)</code></pre>
<p>When we derive the <code>Eq</code> instance for a type and then try
to compare two values of that type with <code>==</code> or
<code>/=</code>, Haskell will see if the value constructors match
(there’s only one value constructor here though) and then it will check
if all the data contained inside matches by testing each pair of fields
with <code>==</code>. There’s only one catch though, the types of all
the fields also have to be part of the <code>Eq</code> typeclass. But
since both <code>String</code> and <code>Int</code> are, we’re OK. Let’s
test our <code>Eq</code> instance.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let mikeD = Person {firstName = &quot;Michael&quot;, lastName = &quot;Diamond&quot;, age = 43}
ghci&gt; let adRock = Person {firstName = &quot;Adam&quot;, lastName = &quot;Horovitz&quot;, age = 41}
ghci&gt; let mca = Person {firstName = &quot;Adam&quot;, lastName = &quot;Yauch&quot;, age = 44}
ghci&gt; mca == adRock
False
ghci&gt; mikeD == adRock
False
ghci&gt; mikeD == mikeD
True
ghci&gt; mikeD == Person {firstName = &quot;Michael&quot;, lastName = &quot;Diamond&quot;, age = 43}
True</code></pre>
<p>Of course, since <code>Person</code> is now in <code>Eq</code>, we
can use it as the <code>a</code> for all functions that have a class
constraint of <code>Eq a</code> in their type signature, such as
<code>elem</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let beastieBoys = [mca, adRock, mikeD]
ghci&gt; mikeD `elem` beastieBoys
True</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Show</code> and <code>Read</code> typeclasses are for
things that can be converted to or from strings, respectively. Like with
<code>Eq</code>, if a type’s constructors have fields, their type has to
be a part of <code>Show</code> or <code>Read</code> if we want to make
our type an instance of them. Let’s make our <code>Person</code> data
type a part of <code>Show</code> and <code>Read</code> as well.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Person = Person { firstName :: String
                     , lastName :: String
                     , age :: Int
                     } deriving (Eq, Show, Read)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can print a person out to the terminal.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let mikeD = Person {firstName = &quot;Michael&quot;, lastName = &quot;Diamond&quot;, age = 43}
ghci&gt; mikeD
Person {firstName = &quot;Michael&quot;, lastName = &quot;Diamond&quot;, age = 43}
ghci&gt; &quot;mikeD is: &quot; ++ show mikeD
&quot;mikeD is: Person {firstName = \&quot;Michael\&quot;, lastName = \&quot;Diamond\&quot;, age = 43}&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Had we tried to print a person on the terminal before making the
<code>Person</code> data type part of <code>Show</code>, Haskell would
have complained at us, claiming it doesn’t know how to represent a
person as a string. But now that we’ve derived a <code>Show</code>
instance for it, it does know.</p>
<p><code>Read</code> is pretty much the inverse typeclass of
<code>Show</code>. <code>Show</code> is for converting values of our a
type to a string, <code>Read</code> is for converting strings to values
of our type. Remember though, when we use the <code>read</code>
function, we have to use an explicit type annotation to tell Haskell
which type we want to get as a result. If we don’t make the type we want
as a result explicit, Haskell doesn’t know which type we want.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; read &quot;Person {firstName =\&quot;Michael\&quot;, lastName =\&quot;Diamond\&quot;, age = 43}&quot; :: Person
Person {firstName = &quot;Michael&quot;, lastName = &quot;Diamond&quot;, age = 43}</code></pre>
<p>If we use the result of our <code>read</code> later on in a way that
Haskell can infer that it should read it as a person, we don’t have to
use type annotation.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; read &quot;Person {firstName =\&quot;Michael\&quot;, lastName =\&quot;Diamond\&quot;, age = 43}&quot; == mikeD
True</code></pre>
<p>We can also read parameterized types, but we have to fill in the type
parameters. So we can’t do <code>read "Just 't'" :: Maybe a</code>, but
we can do <code>read "Just 't'" :: Maybe Char</code>.</p>
<p>We can derive instances for the <code>Ord</code> type class, which is
for types that have values that can be ordered. If we compare two values
of the same type that were made using different constructors, the value
which was made with a constructor that’s defined first is considered
smaller. For instance, consider the <code>Bool</code> type, which can
have a value of either <code>False</code> or <code>True</code>. For the
purpose of seeing how it behaves when compared, we can think of it as
being implemented like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Bool = False | True deriving (Ord)</code></pre>
<p>Because the <code>False</code> value constructor is specified first
and the <code>True</code> value constructor is specified after it, we
can consider <code>True</code> as greater than <code>False</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; True `compare` False
GT
ghci&gt; True &gt; False
True
ghci&gt; True &lt; False
False</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Maybe a</code> data type, the <code>Nothing</code> value
constructor is specified before the <code>Just</code> value constructor,
so a value of <code>Nothing</code> is always smaller than a value of
<code>Just something</code>, even if that something is minus one billion
trillion. But if we compare two <code>Just</code> values, then it goes
to compare what’s inside them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Nothing &lt; Just 100
True
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt; Just (-49999)
False
ghci&gt; Just 3 `compare` Just 2
GT
ghci&gt; Just 100 &gt; Just 50
True</code></pre>
<p>But we can’t do something like <code>Just (*3) &gt; Just (*2)</code>,
because <code>(*3)</code> and <code>(*2)</code> are functions, which
aren’t instances of <code>Ord</code>.</p>
<p>We can easily use algebraic data types to make enumerations and the
<code>Enum</code> and <code>Bounded</code> typeclasses help us with
that. Consider the following data type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Day = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday</code></pre>
<p>Because all the value constructors are nullary (take no parameters,
i.e. fields), we can make it part of the <code>Enum</code> typeclass.
The <code>Enum</code> typeclass is for things that have predecessors and
successors. We can also make it part of the <code>Bounded</code>
typeclass, which is for things that have a lowest possible value and
highest possible value. And while we’re at it, let’s also make it an
instance of all the other derivable typeclasses and see what we can do
with it.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Day = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday
           deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read, Bounded, Enum)</code></pre>
<p>Because it’s part of the <code>Show</code> and <code>Read</code>
typeclasses, we can convert values of this type to and from strings.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Wednesday
Wednesday
ghci&gt; show Wednesday
&quot;Wednesday&quot;
ghci&gt; read &quot;Saturday&quot; :: Day
Saturday</code></pre>
<p>Because it’s part of the <code>Eq</code> and <code>Ord</code>
typeclasses, we can compare or equate days.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Saturday == Sunday
False
ghci&gt; Saturday == Saturday
True
ghci&gt; Saturday &gt; Friday
True
ghci&gt; Monday `compare` Wednesday
LT</code></pre>
<p>It’s also part of <code>Bounded</code>, so we can get the lowest and
highest day.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; minBound :: Day
Monday
ghci&gt; maxBound :: Day
Sunday</code></pre>
<p>It’s also an instance of <code>Enum</code>. We can get predecessors
and successors of days and we can make list ranges from them!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; succ Monday
Tuesday
ghci&gt; pred Saturday
Friday
ghci&gt; [Thursday .. Sunday]
[Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday]
ghci&gt; [minBound .. maxBound] :: [Day]
[Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday]</code></pre>
<p>That’s pretty awesome.</p>
<h2 id="type-synonyms">Type synonyms</h2>
<p>Previously, we mentioned that when writing types, the
<code>[Char]</code> and <code>String</code> types are equivalent and
interchangeable. That’s implemented with <strong>type synonyms</strong>.
Type synonyms don’t really do anything per se, they’re just about giving
some types different names so that they make more sense to someone
reading our code and documentation. Here’s how the standard library
defines <code>String</code> as a synonym for <code>[Char]</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type String = [Char]</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/chicken.png"
class="left" width="169" height="225" alt="chicken" /></p>
<p>We’ve introduced the <em>type</em> keyword. The keyword might be
misleading to some, because we’re not actually making anything new (we
did that with the <em>data</em> keyword), but we’re just making a
synonym for an already existing type.</p>
<p>If we make a function that converts a string to uppercase and call it
<code>toUpperString</code> or something, we can give it a type
declaration of <code>toUpperString :: [Char] -&gt; [Char]</code> or
<code>toUpperString :: String -&gt; String</code>. Both of these are
essentially the same, only the latter is nicer to read.</p>
<p>When we were dealing with the <code>Data.Map</code> module, we first
represented a phonebook with an association list before converting it
into a map. As we’ve already found out, an association list is a list of
key-value pairs. Let’s look at a phonebook that we had.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>phoneBook :: [(String,String)]
phoneBook =
    [(&quot;amelia&quot;,&quot;555-2938&quot;)
    ,(&quot;freya&quot;,&quot;452-2928&quot;)
    ,(&quot;isabella&quot;,&quot;493-2928&quot;)
    ,(&quot;neil&quot;,&quot;205-2928&quot;)
    ,(&quot;roald&quot;,&quot;939-8282&quot;)
    ,(&quot;tenzing&quot;,&quot;853-2492&quot;)
    ]</code></pre>
<p>We see that the type of <code>phoneBook</code> is
<code>[(String,String)]</code>. That tells us that it’s an association
list that maps from strings to strings, but not much else. Let’s make a
type synonym to convey some more information in the type
declaration.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type PhoneBook = [(String,String)]</code></pre>
<p>Now the type declaration for our phonebook can be
<code>phoneBook :: PhoneBook</code>. Let’s make a type synonym for
<code>String</code> as well.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type PhoneNumber = String
type Name = String
type PhoneBook = [(Name,PhoneNumber)]</code></pre>
<p>Giving the <code>String</code> type synonyms is something that
Haskell programmers do when they want to convey more information about
what strings in their functions should be used as and what they
represent.</p>
<p>So now, when we implement a function that takes a name and a number
and sees if that name and number combination is in our phonebook, we can
give it a very pretty and descriptive type declaration.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>inPhoneBook :: Name -&gt; PhoneNumber -&gt; PhoneBook -&gt; Bool
inPhoneBook name pnumber pbook = (name,pnumber) `elem` pbook</code></pre>
<p>If we decided not to use type synonyms, our function would have a
type of
<code>String -&gt; String -&gt; [(String,String)] -&gt; Bool</code>. In
this case, the type declaration that took advantage of type synonyms is
easier to understand. However, you shouldn’t go overboard with them. We
introduce type synonyms either to describe what some existing type
represents in our functions (and thus our type declarations become
better documentation) or when something has a long-ish type that’s
repeated a lot (like <code>[(String,String)]</code>) but represents
something more specific in the context of our functions.</p>
<p>Type synonyms can also be parameterized. If we want a type that
represents an association list type but still want it to be general so
it can use any type as the keys and values, we can do this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type AssocList k v = [(k,v)]</code></pre>
<p>Now, a function that gets the value by a key in an association list
can have a type of
<code>(Eq k) =&gt; k -&gt; AssocList k v -&gt; Maybe v</code>.
<code>AssocList</code> is a type constructor that takes two types and
produces a concrete type, like <code>AssocList Int String</code>, for
instance.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Fonzie says:</strong> Aaay! When I talk about <em>concrete
types</em> I mean like fully applied types like
<code>Map Int String</code> or if we’re dealin’ with one of them
polymorphic functions, <code>[a]</code> or
<code>(Ord a) =&gt; Maybe a</code> and stuff. And like, sometimes me and
my buddies say that <code>Maybe</code> is a type, but we don’t mean
that, cause every idiot knows <code>Maybe</code> is a type constructor.
When I apply an extra type to <code>Maybe</code>, like
<code>Maybe String</code>, then I have a concrete type. You know, values
can only have types that are concrete types! So in conclusion, live
fast, love hard and don’t let anybody else use your comb!</p>
</div>
<p>Just like we can partially apply functions to get new functions, we
can partially apply type parameters and get new type constructors from
them. Just like we call a function with too few parameters to get back a
new function, we can specify a type constructor with too few type
parameters and get back a partially applied type constructor. If we
wanted a type that represents a map (from <code>Data.Map</code>) from
integers to something, we could either do this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type IntMap v = Map Int v</code></pre>
<p>Or we could do it like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type IntMap = Map Int</code></pre>
<p>Either way, the <code>IntMap</code> type constructor takes one
parameter and that is the type of what the integers will point to.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Oh yeah</strong>. If you’re going to try and implement this,
you’ll probably going to do a qualified import of <code>Data.Map</code>.
When you do a qualified import, type constructors also have to be
preceded with a module name. So you’d write
<code>type IntMap = Map.Map Int</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Make sure that you really understand the distinction between type
constructors and value constructors. Just because we made a type synonym
called <code>IntMap</code> or <code>AssocList</code> doesn’t mean that
we can do stuff like <code>AssocList [(1,2),(4,5),(7,9)]</code>. All it
means is that we can refer to its type by using different names. We can
do <code>[(1,2),(3,5),(8,9)] :: AssocList Int Int</code>, which will
make the numbers inside assume a type of <code>Int</code>, but we can
still use that list as we would any normal list that has pairs of
integers inside. Type synonyms (and types generally) can only be used in
the type portion of Haskell. We’re in Haskell’s type portion whenever
we’re defining new types (so in <em>data</em> and <em>type</em>
declarations) or when we’re located after a <code>::</code>. The
<code>::</code> is in type declarations or in type annotations.</p>
<p>Another cool data type that takes two types as its parameters is the
<code>Either a b</code> type. This is roughly how it’s defined:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Either a b = Left a | Right b deriving (Eq, Ord, Read, Show)</code></pre>
<p>It has two value constructors. If the <code>Left</code> is used, then
its contents are of type <code>a</code> and if <code>Right</code> is
used, then its contents are of type <code>b</code>. So we can use this
type to encapsulate a value of one type or another and then when we get
a value of type <code>Either a b</code>, we usually pattern match on
both <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> and we different stuff
based on which one of them it was.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Right 20
Right 20
ghci&gt; Left &quot;w00t&quot;
Left &quot;w00t&quot;
ghci&gt; :t Right &#39;a&#39;
Right &#39;a&#39; :: Either a Char
ghci&gt; :t Left True
Left True :: Either Bool b</code></pre>
<p>So far, we’ve seen that <code>Maybe a</code> was mostly used to
represent the results of computations that could have either failed or
not. But sometimes, <code>Maybe a</code> isn’t good enough because
<code>Nothing</code> doesn’t really convey much information other than
that something has failed. That’s cool for functions that can fail in
only one way or if we’re just not interested in how and why they failed.
A <code>Data.Map</code> lookup fails only if the key we were looking for
wasn’t in the map, so we know exactly what happened. However, when we’re
interested in how some function failed or why, we usually use the result
type of <code>Either a b</code>, where <code>a</code> is some sort of
type that can tell us something about the possible failure and
<code>b</code> is the type of a successful computation. Hence, errors
use the <code>Left</code> value constructor while results use
<code>Right</code>.</p>
<p>An example: a high-school has lockers so that students have some
place to put their Guns’n’Roses posters. Each locker has a code
combination. When a student wants a new locker, they tell the locker
supervisor which locker number they want and he gives them the code.
However, if someone is already using that locker, he can’t tell them the
code for the locker and they have to pick a different one. We’ll use a
map from <code>Data.Map</code> to represent the lockers. It’ll map from
locker numbers to a pair of whether the locker is in use or not and the
locker code.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>import qualified Data.Map as Map

data LockerState = Taken | Free deriving (Show, Eq)

type Code = String

type LockerMap = Map.Map Int (LockerState, Code)</code></pre>
<p>Simple stuff. We introduce a new data type to represent whether a
locker is taken or free and we make a type synonym for the locker code.
We also make a type synonym for the type that maps from integers to
pairs of locker state and code. And now, we’re going to make a function
that searches for the code in a locker map. We’re going to use an
<code>Either String Code</code> type to represent our result, because
our lookup can fail in two ways — the locker can be taken, in which case
we can’t tell the code or the locker number might not exist at all. If
the lookup fails, we’re just going to use a <code>String</code> to tell
what’s happened.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>lockerLookup :: Int -&gt; LockerMap -&gt; Either String Code
lockerLookup lockerNumber map =
    case Map.lookup lockerNumber map of
        Nothing -&gt; Left $ &quot;Locker number &quot; ++ show lockerNumber ++ &quot; doesn&#39;t exist!&quot;
        Just (state, code) -&gt; if state /= Taken
                                then Right code
                                else Left $ &quot;Locker &quot; ++ show lockerNumber ++ &quot; is already taken!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We do a normal lookup in the map. If we get a <code>Nothing</code>,
we return a value of type <code>Left String</code>, saying that the
locker doesn’t exist at all. If we do find it, then we do an additional
check to see if the locker is taken. If it is, return a
<code>Left</code> saying that it’s already taken. If it isn’t, then
return a value of type <code>Right Code</code>, in which we give the
student the correct code for the locker. It’s actually a
<code>Right String</code>, but we introduced that type synonym to
introduce some additional documentation into the type declaration.
Here’s an example map:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>lockers :: LockerMap
lockers = Map.fromList
    [(100,(Taken,&quot;ZD39I&quot;))
    ,(101,(Free,&quot;JAH3I&quot;))
    ,(103,(Free,&quot;IQSA9&quot;))
    ,(105,(Free,&quot;QOTSA&quot;))
    ,(109,(Taken,&quot;893JJ&quot;))
    ,(110,(Taken,&quot;99292&quot;))
    ]</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s try looking up some locker codes.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; lockerLookup 101 lockers
Right &quot;JAH3I&quot;
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 100 lockers
Left &quot;Locker 100 is already taken!&quot;
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 102 lockers
Left &quot;Locker number 102 doesn&#39;t exist!&quot;
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 110 lockers
Left &quot;Locker 110 is already taken!&quot;
ghci&gt; lockerLookup 105 lockers
Right &quot;QOTSA&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We could have used a <code>Maybe a</code> to represent the result but
then we wouldn’t know why we couldn’t get the code. But now, we have
information about the failure in our result type.</p>

class="right" width="168" height="301" alt="the fonz" /></p>
<p>As we’ve seen, a constructor in an algebraic data type can have
several (or none at all) fields and each field must be of some concrete
type. With that in mind, we can make types whose constructors have
fields that are of the same type! Using that, we can create recursive
data types, where one value of some type contains values of that type,
which in turn contain more values of the same type and so on.</p>
<p>Think about this list: <code>[5]</code>. That’s just syntactic sugar
for <code>5:[]</code>. On the left side of the <code>:</code>, there’s a
value and on the right side, there’s a list. And in this case, it’s an
empty list. Now how about the list <code>[4,5]</code>? Well, that
desugars to <code>4:(5:[])</code>. Looking at the first <code>:</code>,
we see that it also has an element on its left side and a list
(<code>5:[]</code>) on its right side. Same goes for a list like
<code>3:(4:(5:6:[]))</code>, which could be written either like that or
like <code>3:4:5:6:[]</code> (because <code>:</code> is
right-associative) or <code>[3,4,5,6]</code>.</p>
<p>We could say that a list can be an empty list or it can be an element
joined together with a <code>:</code> with another list (that can be
either the empty list or not).</p>
<p>Let’s use algebraic data types to implement our own list then!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)</code></pre>
<p>This reads just like our definition of lists from one of the previous
paragraphs. It’s either an empty list or a combination of a head with
some value and a list. If you’re confused about this, you might find it
easier to understand in record syntax.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data List a = Empty | Cons { listHead :: a, listTail :: List a} deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)</code></pre>
<p>You might also be confused about the <code>Cons</code> constructor
here. <em>cons</em> is another word for <code>:</code>. You see, in
lists, <code>:</code> is actually a constructor that takes a value and
another list and returns a list. We can already use our new list type!
In other words, it has two fields. One field is of the type of
<code>a</code> and the other is of the type <code>[a]</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Empty
Empty
ghci&gt; 5 `Cons` Empty
Cons 5 Empty
ghci&gt; 4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty)
Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty)
ghci&gt; 3 `Cons` (4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty))
Cons 3 (Cons 4 (Cons 5 Empty))</code></pre>
<p>We called our <code>Cons</code> constructor in an infix manner so you
can see how it’s just like <code>:</code>. <code>Empty</code> is like
<code>[]</code> and <code>4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty)</code> is like
<code>4:(5:[])</code>.</p>
<p>We can define functions to be automatically infix by making them
comprised of only special characters. We can also do the same with
constructors, since they’re just functions that return a data type. So
check this out.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>infixr 5 :-:
data List a = Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)</code></pre>
<p>First off, we notice a new syntactic construct, the fixity
declarations. When we define functions as operators, we can use that to
give them a fixity (but we don’t have to). A fixity states how tightly
the operator binds and whether it’s left-associative or
right-associative. For instance, <code>*</code>’s fixity is
<code>infixl 7 *</code> and <code>+</code>’s fixity is
<code>infixl 6</code>. That means that they’re both left-associative
(<code>4 * 3 * 2</code> is <code>(4 * 3) * 2</code>) but <code>*</code>
binds tighter than <code>+</code>, because it has a greater fixity, so
<code>5 * 4 + 3</code> is <code>(5 * 4) + 3</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we just wrote <code>a :-: (List a)</code> instead of
<code>Cons a (List a)</code>. Now, we can write out lists in our list
type like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 3 :-: 4 :-: 5 :-: Empty
(:-:) 3 ((:-:) 4 ((:-:) 5 Empty))
ghci&gt; let a = 3 :-: 4 :-: 5 :-: Empty
ghci&gt; 100 :-: a
(:-:) 100 ((:-:) 3 ((:-:) 4 ((:-:) 5 Empty)))</code></pre>
<p>When deriving <code>Show</code> for our type, Haskell will still
display it as if the constructor was a prefix function, hence the
parentheses around the operator (remember, <code>4 + 3</code> is
<code>(+) 4 3</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s make a function that adds two of our lists together. This is
how <code>++</code> is defined for normal lists:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>infixr 5  ++
(++) :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
[]     ++ ys = ys
(x:xs) ++ ys = x : (xs ++ ys)</code></pre>
<p>So we’ll just steal that for our own list. We’ll name the function
<code>.++</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>infixr 5  .++
(.++) :: List a -&gt; List a -&gt; List a
Empty .++ ys = ys
(x :-: xs) .++ ys = x :-: (xs .++ ys)</code></pre>
<p>And let’s see if it works …</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let a = 3 :-: 4 :-: 5 :-: Empty
ghci&gt; let b = 6 :-: 7 :-: Empty
ghci&gt; a .++ b
(:-:) 3 ((:-:) 4 ((:-:) 5 ((:-:) 6 ((:-:) 7 Empty))))</code></pre>
<p>Nice. Is nice. If we wanted, we could implement all of the functions
that operate on lists on our own list type.</p>
<p>Notice how we pattern matched on <code>(x :-: xs)</code>. That works
because pattern matching is actually about matching constructors. We can
match on <code>:-:</code> because it is a constructor for our own list
type and we can also match on <code>:</code> because it is a constructor
for the built-in list type. Same goes for <code>[]</code>. Because
pattern matching works (only) on constructors, we can match for stuff
like that, normal prefix constructors or stuff like <code>8</code> or
<code>'a'</code>, which are basically constructors for the numeric and
character types, respectively.</p>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/binarytree.png"
class="left" width="323" height="225" alt="binary search tree" /></p>
<p>Now, we’re going to implement a <strong>binary search tree</strong>.
If you’re not familiar with binary search trees from languages like C,
here’s what they are: an element points to two elements, one on its left
and one on its right. The element to the left is smaller, the element to
the right is bigger. Each of those elements can also point to two
elements (or one, or none). In effect, each element has up to two
subtrees. And a cool thing about binary search trees is that we know
that all the elements at the left subtree of, say, 5 are going to be
smaller than 5. Elements in its right subtree are going to be bigger. So
if we need to find if 8 is in our tree, we’d start at 5 and then because
8 is greater than 5, we’d go right. We’re now at 7 and because 8 is
greater than 7, we go right again. And we’ve found our element in three
hops! Now if this were a normal list (or a tree, but really unbalanced),
it would take us seven hops instead of three to see if 8 is in
there.</p>
<p>Sets and maps from <code>Data.Set</code> and <code>Data.Map</code>
are implemented using trees, only instead of normal binary search trees,
they use balanced binary search trees, which are always balanced. But
right now, we’ll just be implementing normal binary search trees.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re going to say: a tree is either an empty tree or
it’s an element that contains some value and two trees. Sounds like a
perfect fit for an algebraic data type!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Tree a = EmptyTree | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq)</code></pre>
<p>Okay, good, this is good. Instead of manually building a tree, we’re
going to make a function that takes a tree and an element and inserts an
element. We do this by comparing the value we want to insert to the root
node and then if it’s smaller, we go left, if it’s larger, we go right.
We do the same for every subsequent node until we reach an empty tree.
Once we’ve reached an empty tree, we just insert a node with that value
instead of the empty tree.</p>
<p>In languages like C, we’d do this by modifying the pointers and
values inside the tree. In Haskell, we can’t really modify our tree, so
we have to make a new subtree each time we decide to go left or right
and in the end the insertion function returns a completely new tree,
because Haskell doesn’t really have a concept of pointer, just values.
Hence, the type for our insertion function is going to be something like
<code>a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a</code>. It takes an element and a tree
and returns a new tree that has that element inside. This might seem
like it’s inefficient but laziness takes care of that problem.</p>
<p>So, here are two functions. One is a utility function for making a
singleton tree (a tree with just one node) and a function to insert an
element into a tree.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>singleton :: a -&gt; Tree a
singleton x = Node x EmptyTree EmptyTree

treeInsert :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree a
treeInsert x EmptyTree = singleton x
treeInsert x (Node a left right)
    | x == a = Node x left right
    | x &lt; a  = Node a (treeInsert x left) right
    | x &gt; a  = Node a left (treeInsert x right)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>singleton</code> function is just a shortcut for making a
node that has something and then two empty subtrees. In the insertion
function, we first have the edge condition as a pattern. If we’ve
reached an empty subtree, that means we’re where we want and instead of
the empty tree, we put a singleton tree with our element. If we’re not
inserting into an empty tree, then we have to check some things. First
off, if the element we’re inserting is equal to the root element, just
return a tree that’s the same. If it’s smaller, return a tree that has
the same root value, the same right subtree but instead of its left
subtree, put a tree that has our value inserted into it. Same (but the
other way around) goes if our value is bigger than the root element.</p>
<p>Next up, we’re going to make a function that checks if some element
is in the tree. First, let’s define the edge condition. If we’re looking
for an element in an empty tree, then it’s certainly not there. Okay.
Notice how this is the same as the edge condition when searching for
elements in lists. If we’re looking for an element in an empty list,
it’s not there. Anyway, if we’re not looking for an element in an empty
tree, then we check some things. If the element in the root node is what
we’re looking for, great! If it’s not, what then? Well, we can take
advantage of knowing that all the left elements are smaller than the
root node. So if the element we’re looking for is smaller than the root
node, check to see if it’s in the left subtree. If it’s bigger, check to
see if it’s in the right subtree.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>treeElem :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Bool
treeElem x EmptyTree = False
treeElem x (Node a left right)
    | x == a = True
    | x &lt; a  = treeElem x left
    | x &gt; a  = treeElem x right</code></pre>
<p>All we had to do was write up the previous paragraph in code. Let’s
have some fun with our trees! Instead of manually building one (although
we could), we’ll use a fold to build up a tree from a list. Remember,
pretty much everything that traverses a list one by one and then returns
some sort of value can be implemented with a fold! We’re going to start
with the empty tree and then approach a list from the right and just
insert element after element into our accumulator tree.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let nums = [8,6,4,1,7,3,5]
ghci&gt; let numsTree = foldr treeInsert EmptyTree nums
ghci&gt; numsTree
Node 5 (Node 3 (Node 1 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 4 EmptyTree EmptyTree)) (Node 7 (Node 6 EmptyTree EmptyTree) (Node 8 EmptyTree EmptyTree))</code></pre>
<p>In that <code>foldr</code>, <code>treeInsert</code> was the folding
function (it takes a tree and a list element and produces a new tree)
and <code>EmptyTree</code> was the starting accumulator.
<code>nums</code>, of course, was the list we were folding over.</p>
<p>When we print our tree to the console, it’s not very readable, but if
we try, we can make out its structure. We see that the root node is 5
and then it has two subtrees, one of which has the root node of 3 and
the other a 7, etc.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 8 `treeElem` numsTree
True
ghci&gt; 100 `treeElem` numsTree
False
ghci&gt; 1 `treeElem` numsTree
True
ghci&gt; 10 `treeElem` numsTree
False</code></pre>
<p>Checking for membership also works nicely. Cool.</p>
<p>So as you can see, algebraic data structures are a really cool and
powerful concept in Haskell. We can use them to make anything from
boolean values and weekday enumerations to binary search trees and
more!</p>
<h2 id="typeclasses-102">Typeclasses 102</h2>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/trafficlight.png"
class="right" width="175" height="480" alt="tweet" /></p>
<p>So far, we’ve learned about some of the standard Haskell typeclasses
and we’ve seen which types are in them. We’ve also learned how to
automatically make our own types instances of the standard typeclasses
by asking Haskell to derive the instances for us. In this section, we’re
going to learn how to make our own typeclasses and how to make types
instances of them by hand.</p>
<p>A quick recap on typeclasses: typeclasses are like interfaces. A
typeclass defines some behavior (like comparing for equality, comparing
for ordering, enumeration) and then types that can behave in that way
are made instances of that typeclass. The behavior of typeclasses is
achieved by defining functions or just type declarations that we then
implement. So when we say that a type is an instance of a typeclass, we
mean that we can use the functions that the typeclass defines with that
type.</p>
<p>Typeclasses have pretty much nothing to do with classes in languages
like Java or Python. This confuses many people, so I want you to forget
everything you know about classes in imperative languages right now.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>Eq</code> typeclass is for stuff that can be
equated. It defines the functions <code>==</code> and <code>/=</code>.
If we have a type (say, <code>Car</code>) and comparing two cars with
the equality function <code>==</code> makes sense, then it makes sense
for <code>Car</code> to be an instance of <code>Eq</code>.</p>
<p>This is how the <code>Eq</code> class is defined in the standard
prelude:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    x == y = not (x /= y)
    x /= y = not (x == y)</code></pre>
<p>Woah, woah, woah! Some new strange syntax and keywords there! Don’t
worry, this will all be clear in a second. First off, when we write
<code>class Eq a where</code>, this means that we’re defining a new
typeclass and that’s called <code>Eq</code>. The <code>a</code> is the
type variable and it means that <code>a</code> will play the role of the
type that we will soon be making an instance of <code>Eq</code>. It
doesn’t have to be called <code>a</code>, it doesn’t even have to be one
letter, it just has to be a lowercase word. Then, we define several
functions. It’s not mandatory to implement the function bodies
themselves, we just have to specify the type declarations for the
functions.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Some people might understand this better if we wrote
<code>class Eq equatable where</code> and then specified the type
declarations like
<code>(==) :: equatable -&gt; equatable -&gt; Bool</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>Anyway, we <em>did</em> implement the function bodies for the
functions that <code>Eq</code> defines, only we defined them in terms of
mutual recursion. We said that two instances of <code>Eq</code> are
equal if they are not different and they are different if they are not
equal. We didn’t have to do this, really, but we did and we’ll see how
this helps us soon.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>If we have say <code>class Eq a where</code> and then define a type
declaration within that class like
<code>(==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>, then when we examine the type
of that function later on, it will have the type of
<code>(Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>So once we have a class, what can we do with it? Well, not much,
really. But once we start making types instances of that class, we start
getting some nice functionality. So check out this type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data TrafficLight = Red | Yellow | Green</code></pre>
<p>It defines the states of a traffic light. Notice how we didn’t derive
any class instances for it. That’s because we’re going to write up some
instances by hand, even though we could derive them for types like
<code>Eq</code> and <code>Show</code>. Here’s how we make it an instance
of <code>Eq</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Eq TrafficLight where
    Red == Red = True
    Green == Green = True
    Yellow == Yellow = True
    _ == _ = False</code></pre>
<p>We did it by using the <em>instance</em> keyword. So <em>class</em>
is for defining new typeclasses and <em>instance</em> is for making our
types instances of typeclasses. When we were defining <code>Eq</code>,
we wrote <code>class Eq a where</code> and we said that <code>a</code>
plays the role of whichever type will be made an instance later on. We
can see that clearly here, because when we’re making an instance, we
write <code>instance Eq TrafficLight where</code>. We replace the
<code>a</code> with the actual type.</p>
<p>Because <code>==</code> was defined in terms of <code>/=</code> and
vice versa in the <em>class</em> declaration, we only had to overwrite
one of them in the instance declaration. That’s called the minimal
complete definition for the typeclass — the minimum of functions that we
have to implement so that our type can behave like the class advertises.
To fulfill the minimal complete definition for <code>Eq</code>, we have
to overwrite either one of <code>==</code> or <code>/=</code>. If
<code>Eq</code> was defined simply like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code></pre>
<p>we’d have to implement both of these functions when making a type an
instance of it, because Haskell wouldn’t know how these two functions
are related. The minimal complete definition would then be: both
<code>==</code> and <code>/=</code>.</p>
<p>You can see that we implemented <code>==</code> simply by doing
pattern matching. Since there are many more cases where two lights
aren’t equal, we specified the ones that are equal and then just did a
catch-all pattern saying that if it’s none of the previous combinations,
then two lights aren’t equal.</p>
<p>Let’s make this an instance of <code>Show</code> by hand, too. To
satisfy the minimal complete definition for <code>Show</code>, we just
have to implement its <code>show</code> function, which takes a value
and turns it into a string.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Show TrafficLight where
    show Red = &quot;Red light&quot;
    show Yellow = &quot;Yellow light&quot;
    show Green = &quot;Green light&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Once again, we used pattern matching to achieve our goals. Let’s see
how it works in action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Red == Red
True
ghci&gt; Red == Yellow
False
ghci&gt; Red `elem` [Red, Yellow, Green]
True
ghci&gt; [Red, Yellow, Green]
[Red light,Yellow light,Green light]</code></pre>
<p>Nice. We could have just derived <code>Eq</code> and it would have
had the same effect (but we didn’t for educational purposes). However,
deriving <code>Show</code> would have just directly translated the value
constructors to strings. But if we want lights to appear like
<code>"Red light"</code>, then we have to make the instance declaration
by hand.</p>
<p>You can also make typeclasses that are subclasses of other
typeclasses. The <em>class</em> declaration for <code>Num</code> is a
bit long, but here’s the first part:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class (Eq a) =&gt; Num a where
   ...</code></pre>
<p>As we mentioned previously, there are a lot of places where we can
cram in class constraints. So this is just like writing
<code>class Num a where</code>, only we state that our type
<code>a</code> must be an instance of <code>Eq</code>. We’re essentially
saying that we have to make a type an instance of <code>Eq</code> before
we can make it an instance of <code>Num</code>. Before some type can be
considered a number, it makes sense that we can determine whether values
of that type can be equated or not. That’s all there is to subclassing
really, it’s just a class constraint on a <em>class</em> declaration!
When defining function bodies in the <em>class</em> declaration or when
defining them in <em>instance</em> declarations, we can assume that
<code>a</code> is a part of <code>Eq</code> and so we can use
<code>==</code> on values of that type.</p>
<p>But how are the <code>Maybe</code> or list types made as instances of
typeclasses? What makes <code>Maybe</code> different from, say,
<code>TrafficLight</code> is that <code>Maybe</code> in itself isn’t a
concrete type, it’s a type constructor that takes one type parameter
(like <code>Char</code> or something) to produce a concrete type (like
<code>Maybe Char</code>). Let’s take a look at the <code>Eq</code>
typeclass again:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Eq a where
    (==) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    (/=) :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool
    x == y = not (x /= y)
    x /= y = not (x == y)</code></pre>
<p>From the type declarations, we see that the <code>a</code> is used as
a concrete type because all the types in functions have to be concrete
(remember, you can’t have a function of the type
<code>a -&gt; Maybe</code> but you can have a function of
<code>a -&gt; Maybe a</code> or
<code>Maybe Int -&gt; Maybe String</code>). That’s why we can’t do
something like</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Eq Maybe where
    ...</code></pre>
<p>Because like we’ve seen, the <code>a</code> has to be a concrete type
but <code>Maybe</code> isn’t a concrete type. It’s a type constructor
that takes one parameter and then produces a concrete type. It would
also be tedious to write <code>instance Eq (Maybe Int) where</code>,
<code>instance Eq (Maybe Char) where</code>, etc. for every type ever.
So we could write it out like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Eq (Maybe m) where
    Just x == Just y = x == y
    Nothing == Nothing = True
    _ == _ = False</code></pre>
<p>This is like saying that we want to make all types of the form
<code>Maybe something</code> an instance of <code>Eq</code>. We actually
could have written <code>(Maybe something)</code>, but we usually opt
for single letters to be true to the Haskell style. The
<code>(Maybe m)</code> here plays the role of the <code>a</code> from
<code>class Eq a where</code>. While <code>Maybe</code> isn’t a concrete
type, <code>Maybe m</code> is. By specifying a type parameter
(<code>m</code>, which is in lowercase), we said that we want all types
that are in the form of <code>Maybe m</code>, where <code>m</code> is
any type, to be an instance of <code>Eq</code>.</p>
<p>There’s one problem with this though. Can you spot it? We use
<code>==</code> on the contents of the <code>Maybe</code> but we have no
assurance that what the <code>Maybe</code> contains can be used with
<code>Eq</code>! That’s why we have to modify our <em>instance</em>
declaration like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance (Eq m) =&gt; Eq (Maybe m) where
    Just x == Just y = x == y
    Nothing == Nothing = True
    _ == _ = False</code></pre>
<p>We had to add a class constraint! With this <em>instance</em>
declaration, we say this: we want all types of the form
<code>Maybe m</code> to be part of the <code>Eq</code> typeclass, but
only those types where the <code>m</code> (so what’s contained inside
the <code>Maybe</code>) is also a part of <code>Eq</code>. This is
actually how Haskell would derive the instance too.</p>
<p>Most of the times, class constraints in <em>class</em> declarations
are used for making a typeclass a subclass of another typeclass and
class constraints in <em>instance</em> declarations are used to express
requirements about the contents of some type. For instance, here we
required the contents of the <code>Maybe</code> to also be part of the
<code>Eq</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>When making instances, if you see that a type is used as a concrete
type in the type declarations (like the <code>a</code> in
<code>a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>), you have to supply type parameters
and add parentheses so that you end up with a concrete type.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Take into account that the type you’re trying to make an instance of
will replace the parameter in the <em>class</em> declaration. The
<code>a</code> from <code>class Eq a where</code> will be replaced with
a real type when you make an instance, so try mentally putting your type
into the function type declarations as well.
<code>(==) :: Maybe -&gt; Maybe -&gt; Bool</code> doesn’t make much
sense but
<code>(==) :: (Eq m) =&gt; Maybe m -&gt; Maybe m -&gt; Bool</code> does.
But this is just something to think about, because <code>==</code> will
always have a type of
<code>(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>, no matter what
instances we make.</p>
</div>
<p>Ooh, one more thing, check this out! If you want to see what the
instances of a typeclass are, just do <code>:info YourTypeClass</code>
in GHCI. So typing <code>:info Num</code> will show which functions the
typeclass defines and it will give you a list of the types in the
typeclass. <code>:info</code> works for types and type constructors too.
If you do <code>:info Maybe</code>, it will show you all the typeclasses
that <code>Maybe</code> is an instance of. Also <code>:info</code> can
show you the type declaration of a function. I think that’s pretty
cool.</p>
<h2 id="a-yes-no-typeclass">A yes-no typeclass</h2>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/yesno.png"
class="left" width="201" height="111" alt="yesno" /></p>
<p>In JavaScript and some other weakly typed languages, you can put
almost anything inside an if expression. For example, you can do all of
the following: <code>if (0) alert("YEAH!") else alert("NO!")</code>,
<code>if ("") alert ("YEAH!") else alert("NO!")</code>,
<code>if (false) alert("YEAH") else alert("NO!)</code>, etc. and all of
these will throw an alert of <code>NO!</code>. If you do
<code>if ("WHAT") alert ("YEAH") else alert("NO!")</code>, it will alert
a <code>"YEAH!"</code> because JavaScript considers non-empty strings to
be a sort of true-ish value.</p>
<p>Even though strictly using <code>Bool</code> for boolean semantics
works better in Haskell, let’s try and implement that JavaScript-ish
behavior anyway. For fun! Let’s start out with a <em>class</em>
declaration.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class YesNo a where
    yesno :: a -&gt; Bool</code></pre>
<p>Pretty simple. The <code>YesNo</code> typeclass defines one function.
That function takes one value of a type that can be considered to hold
some concept of true-ness and tells us for sure if it’s true or not.
Notice that from the way we use the <code>a</code> in the function,
<code>a</code> has to be a concrete type.</p>
<p>Next up, let’s define some instances. For numbers, we’ll assume that
(like in JavaScript) any number that isn’t 0 is true-ish and 0 is
false-ish.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance YesNo Int where
    yesno 0 = False
    yesno _ = True</code></pre>
<p>Empty lists (and by extensions, strings) are a no-ish value, while
non-empty lists are a yes-ish value.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance YesNo [a] where
    yesno [] = False
    yesno _ = True</code></pre>
<p>Notice how we just put in a type parameter <code>a</code> in there to
make the list a concrete type, even though we don’t make any assumptions
about the type that’s contained in the list. What else, hmm … I know,
<code>Bool</code> itself also holds true-ness and false-ness and it’s
pretty obvious which is which.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance YesNo Bool where
    yesno = id</code></pre>
<p>Huh? What’s <code>id</code>? It’s just a standard library function
that takes a parameter and returns the same thing, which is what we
would be writing here anyway.</p>
<p>Let’s make <code>Maybe a</code> an instance too.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance YesNo (Maybe a) where
    yesno (Just _) = True
    yesno Nothing = False</code></pre>
<p>We didn’t need a class constraint because we made no assumptions
about the contents of the <code>Maybe</code>. We just said that it’s
true-ish if it’s a <code>Just</code> value and false-ish if it’s a
<code>Nothing</code>. We still had to write out <code>(Maybe a)</code>
instead of just <code>Maybe</code> because if you think about it, a
<code>Maybe -&gt; Bool</code> function can’t exist (because
<code>Maybe</code> isn’t a concrete type), whereas a
<code>Maybe a -&gt; Bool</code> is fine and dandy. Still, this is really
cool because now, any type of the form <code>Maybe something</code> is
part of <code>YesNo</code> and it doesn’t matter what that
<code>something</code> is.</p>
<p>Previously, we defined a <code>Tree a</code> type, that represented a
binary search tree. We can say an empty tree is false-ish and anything
that’s not an empty tree is true-ish.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance YesNo (Tree a) where
    yesno EmptyTree = False
    yesno _ = True</code></pre>
<p>Can a traffic light be a yes or no value? Sure. If it’s red, you
stop. If it’s green, you go. If it’s yellow? Eh, I usually run the
yellows because I live for adrenaline.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance YesNo TrafficLight where
    yesno Red = False
    yesno _ = True</code></pre>
<p>Cool, now that we have some instances, let’s go play!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; yesno $ length []
False
ghci&gt; yesno &quot;haha&quot;
True
ghci&gt; yesno &quot;&quot;
False
ghci&gt; yesno $ Just 0
True
ghci&gt; yesno True
True
ghci&gt; yesno EmptyTree
False
ghci&gt; yesno []
False
ghci&gt; yesno [0,0,0]
True
ghci&gt; :t yesno
yesno :: (YesNo a) =&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code></pre>
<p>Right, it works! Let’s make a function that mimics the if statement,
but it works with <code>YesNo</code> values.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>yesnoIf :: (YesNo y) =&gt; y -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
yesnoIf yesnoVal yesResult noResult = if yesno yesnoVal then yesResult else noResult</code></pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward. It takes a yes-no-ish value and two things.
If the yes-no-ish value is more of a yes, it returns the first of the
two things, otherwise it returns the second of them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; yesnoIf [] &quot;YEAH!&quot; &quot;NO!&quot;
&quot;NO!&quot;
ghci&gt; yesnoIf [2,3,4] &quot;YEAH!&quot; &quot;NO!&quot;
&quot;YEAH!&quot;
ghci&gt; yesnoIf True &quot;YEAH!&quot; &quot;NO!&quot;
&quot;YEAH!&quot;
ghci&gt; yesnoIf (Just 500) &quot;YEAH!&quot; &quot;NO!&quot;
&quot;YEAH!&quot;
ghci&gt; yesnoIf Nothing &quot;YEAH!&quot; &quot;NO!&quot;
&quot;NO!&quot;</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-functor-typeclass">The Functor typeclass</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve encountered a lot of the typeclasses in the standard
library. We’ve played with <code>Ord</code>, which is for stuff that can
be ordered. We’ve palled around with <code>Eq</code>, which is for
things that can be equated. We’ve seen <code>Show</code>, which presents
an interface for types whose values can be displayed as strings. Our
good friend <code>Read</code> is there whenever we need to convert a
string to a value of some type. And now, we’re going to take a look at
the <code class="label class">Functor</code> typeclass, which is
basically for things that can be mapped over. You’re probably thinking
about lists now, since mapping over lists is such a dominant idiom in
Haskell. And you’re right, the list type is part of the
<code>Functor</code> typeclass.</p>
<p>What better way to get to know the <code>Functor</code> typeclass
than to see how it’s implemented? Let’s take a peek.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/functor.png"
class="right" width="220" height="441" alt="I AM FUNCTOOOOR!!!" /></p>
<p>Alright. We see that it defines one function, <code>fmap</code>, and
doesn’t provide any default implementation for it. The type of
<code>fmap</code> is interesting. In the definitions of typeclasses so
far, the type variable that played the role of the type in the typeclass
was a concrete type, like the <code>a</code> in
<code>(==) :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool</code>. But now, the
<code>f</code> is not a concrete type (a type that a value can hold,
like <code>Int</code>, <code>Bool</code> or <code>Maybe String</code>),
but a type constructor that takes one type parameter. A quick refresher
example: <code>Maybe Int</code> is a concrete type, but
<code>Maybe</code> is a type constructor that takes one type as the
parameter. Anyway, we see that <code>fmap</code> takes a function from
one type to another and a functor applied with one type and returns a
functor applied with another type.</p>
<p>If this sounds a bit confusing, don’t worry. All will be revealed
soon when we check out a few examples. Hmm, this type declaration for
<code>fmap</code> reminds me of something. If you don’t know what the
type signature of <code>map</code> is, it’s:
<code>map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]</code>.</p>
<p>Ah, interesting! It takes a function from one type to another and a
list of one type and returns a list of another type. My friends, I think
we have ourselves a functor! In fact, <code>map</code> is just a
<code>fmap</code> that works only on lists. Here’s how the list is an
instance of the <code>Functor</code> typeclass.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! Notice how we didn’t write
<code>instance Functor [a] where</code>, because from
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code>, we see that the
<code>f</code> has to be a type constructor that takes one type.
<code>[a]</code> is already a concrete type (of a list with any type
inside it), while <code>[]</code> is a type constructor that takes one
type and can produce types such as <code>[Int]</code>,
<code>[String]</code> or even <code>[[String]]</code>.</p>
<p>Since for lists, <code>fmap</code> is just <code>map</code>, we get
the same results when using them on lists.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) [1..3]
[2,4,6]
ghci&gt; map (*2) [1..3]
[2,4,6]</code></pre>
<p>What happens when we <code>map</code> or <code>fmap</code> over an
empty list? Well, of course, we get an empty list. It just turns an
empty list of type <code>[a]</code> into an empty list of type
<code>[b]</code>.</p>
<p>Types that can act like a box can be functors. You can think of a
list as a box that has an infinite amount of little compartments and
they can all be empty, one can be full and the others empty or a number
of them can be full. So, what else has the properties of being like a
box? For one, the <code>Maybe a</code> type. In a way, it’s like a box
that can either hold nothing, in which case it has the value of
<code>Nothing</code>, or it can hold one item, like <code>"HAHA"</code>,
in which case it has a value of <code>Just "HAHA"</code>. Here’s how
<code>Maybe</code> is a functor.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
    fmap f Nothing = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Again, notice how we wrote <code>instance Functor Maybe where</code>
instead of <code>instance Functor (Maybe m) where</code>, like we did
when we were dealing with <code>Maybe</code> and <code>YesNo</code>.
<code>Functor</code> wants a type constructor that takes one type and
not a concrete type. If you mentally replace the <code>f</code>s with
<code>Maybe</code>s, <code>fmap</code> acts like a
<code>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code> for this particular
type, which looks OK. But if you replace <code>f</code> with
<code>(Maybe m)</code>, then it would seem to act like a
<code>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe m a -&gt; Maybe m b</code>, which doesn’t
make any damn sense because <code>Maybe</code> takes just one type
parameter.</p>
<p>Anyway, the <code>fmap</code> implementation is pretty simple. If
it’s an empty value of <code>Nothing</code>, then just return a
<code>Nothing</code>. If we map over an empty box, we get an empty box.
It makes sense. Just like if we map over an empty list, we get back an
empty list. If it’s not an empty value, but rather a single value packed
up in a <code>Just</code>, then we apply the function on the contents of
the <code>Just</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap (++ &quot; HEY GUYS IM INSIDE THE JUST&quot;) (Just &quot;Something serious.&quot;)
Just &quot;Something serious. HEY GUYS IM INSIDE THE JUST&quot;
ghci&gt; fmap (++ &quot; HEY GUYS IM INSIDE THE JUST&quot;) Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) (Just 200)
Just 400
ghci&gt; fmap (*2) Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Another thing that can be mapped over and made an instance of
<code>Functor</code> is our <code>Tree a</code> type. It can be thought
of as a box in a way (holds several or no values) and the
<code>Tree</code> type constructor takes exactly one type parameter. If
you look at <code>fmap</code> as if it were a function made only for
<code>Tree</code>, its type signature would look like
<code>(a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b</code>. We’re going to use
recursion on this one. Mapping over an empty tree will produce an empty
tree. Mapping over a non-empty tree will be a tree consisting of our
function applied to the root value and its left and right subtrees will
be the previous subtrees, only our function will be mapped over
them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor Tree where
    fmap f EmptyTree = EmptyTree
    fmap f (Node x leftsub rightsub) = Node (f x) (fmap f leftsub) (fmap f rightsub)</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap (*2) EmptyTree
EmptyTree
ghci&gt; fmap (*4) (foldr treeInsert EmptyTree [5,7,3,2,1,7])
Node 28 (Node 4 EmptyTree (Node 8 EmptyTree (Node 12 EmptyTree (Node 20 EmptyTree EmptyTree)))) EmptyTree</code></pre>
<p>Nice! Now how about <code>Either a b</code>? Can this be made a
functor? The <code>Functor</code> typeclass wants a type constructor
that takes only one type parameter but <code>Either</code> takes two.
Hmmm! I know, we’ll partially apply <code>Either</code> by feeding it
only one parameter so that it has one free parameter. Here’s how
<code>Either a</code> is a functor in the standard libraries:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor (Either a) where
    fmap f (Right x) = Right (f x)
    fmap f (Left x) = Left x</code></pre>
<p>Well well, what did we do here? You can see how we made
<code>Either a</code> an instance instead of just <code>Either</code>.
That’s because <code>Either a</code> is a type constructor that takes
one parameter, whereas <code>Either</code> takes two. If
<code>fmap</code> was specifically for <code>Either a</code>, the type
signature would then be
<code>(b -&gt; c) -&gt; Either a b -&gt; Either a c</code> because
that’s the same as
<code>(b -&gt; c) -&gt; (Either a) b -&gt; (Either a) c</code>. In the
implementation, we mapped in the case of a <code>Right</code> value
constructor, but we didn’t in the case of a <code>Left</code>. Why is
that? Well, if we look back at how the <code>Either a b</code> type is
defined, it’s kind of like:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Either a b = Left a | Right b</code></pre>
<p>Well, if we wanted to map one function over both of them,
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> would have to be the same type. I
mean, if we tried to map a function that takes a string and returns a
string and the <code>b</code> was a string but the <code>a</code> was a
number, that wouldn’t really work out. Also, from seeing what
<code>fmap</code>’s type would be if it operated only on
<code>Either</code> values, we see that the first parameter has to
remain the same while the second one can change and the first parameter
is actualized by the <code>Left</code> value constructor.</p>
<p>This also goes nicely with our box analogy if we think of the
<code>Left</code> part as sort of an empty box with an error message
written on the side telling us why it’s empty.</p>
<p>Maps from <code>Data.Map</code> can also be made a functor because
they hold values (or not!). In the case of <code>Map k v</code>,
<code>fmap</code> will map a function <code>v -&gt; v'</code> over a map
of type <code>Map k v</code> and return a map of type
<code>Map k v'</code>.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Note, the <code>'</code> has no special meaning in types just like it
doesn’t have special meaning when naming values. It’s used to denote
things that are similar, only slightly changed.</p>
</div>
<p>Try figuring out how <code>Map k</code> is made an instance of
<code>Functor</code> by yourself!</p>
<p>With the <code>Functor</code> typeclass, we’ve seen how typeclasses
can represent pretty cool higher-order concepts. We’ve also had some
more practice with partially applying types and making instances. In one
of the next chapters, we’ll also take a look at some laws that apply for
functors.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p><strong>Just one more thing!</strong> Functors should obey some laws
so that they may have some properties that we can depend on and not
think about too much. If we use <code>fmap (+1)</code> over the list
<code>[1,2,3,4]</code>, we expect the result to be
<code>[2,3,4,5]</code> and not its reverse, <code>[5,4,3,2]</code>. If
we use <code>fmap (\a -&gt; a)</code> (the identity function, which just
returns its parameter) over some list, we expect to get back the same
list as a result. For example, if we gave the wrong functor instance to
our <code>Tree</code> type, using <code>fmap</code> over a tree where
the left subtree of a node only has elements that are smaller than the
node and the right subtree only has nodes that are larger than the node
might produce a tree where that’s not the case. We’ll go over the
functor laws in more detail in one of the next chapters.</p>

<p><img
src="assets/images/making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses/typefoo.png"
class="right" width="287" height="400" alt="TYPE FOO MASTER" /></p>
<p>Type constructors take other types as parameters to eventually
produce concrete types. That kind of reminds me of functions, which take
values as parameters to produce values. We’ve seen that type
constructors can be partially applied (<code>Either String</code> is a
type that takes one type and produces a concrete type, like
<code>Either String Int</code>), just like functions can. This is all
very interesting indeed. In this section, we’ll take a look at formally
defining how types are applied to type constructors, just like we took a
look at formally defining how values are applied to functions by using
type declarations. <strong>You don’t really have to read this section to
continue on your magical Haskell quest</strong> and if you don’t
understand it, don’t worry about it. However, getting this will give you
a very thorough understanding of the type system.</p>
<p>So, values like <code>3</code>, <code>"YEAH"</code> or
<code>takeWhile</code> (functions are also values, because we can pass
them around and such) each have their own type. Types are little labels
that values carry so that we can reason about the values. But types have
their own little labels, called <strong>kinds</strong>. A kind is more
or less the type of a type. This may sound a bit weird and confusing,
but it’s actually a really cool concept.</p>
<p>What are kinds and what are they good for? Well, let’s examine the
kind of a type by using the <code>:k</code> command in GHCI.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :k Int
Int :: *</code></pre>
<p>A star? How quaint. What does that mean? A <code>*</code> means that
the type is a concrete type. A concrete type is a type that doesn’t take
any type parameters and values can only have types that are concrete
types. If I had to read <code>*</code> out loud (I haven’t had to do
that so far), I’d say <em>star</em> or just <em>type</em>.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s see what the kind of <code>Maybe</code> is.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :k Maybe
Maybe :: * -&gt; *</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Maybe</code> type constructor takes one concrete type (like
<code>Int</code>) and then returns a concrete type like
<code>Maybe Int</code>. And that’s what this kind tells us. Just like
<code>Int -&gt; Int</code> means that a function takes an
<code>Int</code> and returns an <code>Int</code>, <code>* -&gt; *</code>
means that the type constructor takes one concrete type and returns a
concrete type. Let’s apply the type parameter to <code>Maybe</code> and
see what the kind of that type is.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :k Maybe Int
Maybe Int :: *</code></pre>
<p>Just like I expected! We applied the type parameter to
<code>Maybe</code> and got back a concrete type (that’s what
<code>* -&gt; *</code> means). A parallel (although not equivalent,
types and kinds are two different things) to this is if we do
<code>:t isUpper</code> and <code>:t isUpper 'A'</code>.
<code>isUpper</code> has a type of <code>Char -&gt; Bool</code> and
<code>isUpper 'A'</code> has a type of <code>Bool</code>, because its
value is basically <code>True</code>. Both those types, however, have a
kind of <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>We used <code>:k</code> on a type to get its kind, just like we can
use <code>:t</code> on a value to get its type. Like we said, types are
the labels of values and kinds are the labels of types and there are
parallels between the two.</p>
<p>Let’s look at another kind.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :k Either
Either :: * -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></pre>
<p>Aha, this tells us that <code>Either</code> takes two concrete types
as type parameters to produce a concrete type. It also looks kind of
like a type declaration of a function that takes two values and returns
something. Type constructors are curried (just like functions), so we
can partially apply them.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :k Either String
Either String :: * -&gt; *
ghci&gt; :k Either String Int
Either String Int :: *</code></pre>
<p>When we wanted to make <code>Either</code> a part of the
<code>Functor</code> typeclass, we had to partially apply it because
<code>Functor</code> wants types that take only one parameter while
<code>Either</code> takes two. In other words, <code>Functor</code>
wants types of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code> and so we had to partially
apply <code>Either</code> to get a type of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code>
instead of its original kind <code>* -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. If we look
at the definition of <code>Functor</code> again</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>we see that the <code>f</code> type variable is used as a type that
takes one concrete type to produce a concrete type. We know it has to
produce a concrete type because it’s used as the type of a value in a
function. And from that, we can deduce that types that want to be
friends with <code>Functor</code> have to be of kind
<code>* -&gt; *</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s do some type-foo. Take a look at this typeclass that I’m
just going to make up right now:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Tofu t where
    tofu :: j a -&gt; t a j</code></pre>
<p>Man, that looks weird. How would we make a type that could be an
instance of that strange typeclass? Well, let’s look at what its kind
would have to be. Because <code>j a</code> is used as the type of a
value that the <code>tofu</code> function takes as its parameter,
<code>j a</code> has to have a kind of <code>*</code>. We assume
<code>*</code> for <code>a</code> and so we can infer that
<code>j</code> has to have a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. We see that
<code>t</code> has to produce a concrete value too and that it takes two
types. And knowing that <code>a</code> has a kind of <code>*</code> and
<code>j</code> has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>, we infer that
<code>t</code> has to have a kind of
<code>* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code>. So it takes a concrete type
(<code>a</code>), a type constructor that takes one concrete type
(<code>j</code>) and produces a concrete type. Wow.</p>
<p>OK, so let’s make a type with a kind of
<code>* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code>. Here’s one way of going about
it.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Frank a b  = Frank {frankField :: b a} deriving (Show)</code></pre>
<p>How do we know this type has a kind of
<code>* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) - &gt; *</code>? Well, fields in ADTs are made
to hold values, so they must be of kind <code>*</code>, obviously. We
assume <code>*</code> for <code>a</code>, which means that
<code>b</code> takes one type parameter and so its kind is
<code>* -&gt; *</code>. Now we know the kinds of both <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> and because they’re parameters for <code>Frank</code>, we
see that <code>Frank</code> has a kind of
<code>* -&gt; (* -&gt; *) -&gt; *</code> The first <code>*</code>
represents <code>a</code> and the <code>(* -&gt; *)</code> represents
<code>b</code>. Let’s make some <code>Frank</code> values and check out
their types.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :t Frank {frankField = Just &quot;HAHA&quot;}
Frank {frankField = Just &quot;HAHA&quot;} :: Frank [Char] Maybe
ghci&gt; :t Frank {frankField = Node &#39;a&#39; EmptyTree EmptyTree}
Frank {frankField = Node &#39;a&#39; EmptyTree EmptyTree} :: Frank Char Tree
ghci&gt; :t Frank {frankField = &quot;YES&quot;}
Frank {frankField = &quot;YES&quot;} :: Frank Char []</code></pre>
<p>Hmm. Because <code>frankField</code> has a type of form
<code>a b</code>, its values must have types that are of a similar form
as well. So they can be <code>Just "HAHA"</code>, which has a type of
<code>Maybe [Char]</code> or it can have a value of
<code>['Y','E','S']</code>, which has a type of <code>[Char]</code> (if
we used our own list type for this, it would have a type of
<code>List Char</code>). And we see that the types of the
<code>Frank</code> values correspond with the kind for
<code>Frank</code>. <code>[Char]</code> has a kind of <code>*</code> and
<code>Maybe</code> has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. Because in
order to have a value, it has to be a concrete type and thus has to be
fully applied, every value of <code>Frank blah blaah</code> has a kind
of <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>Making <code>Frank</code> an instance of <code>Tofu</code> is pretty
simple. We see that <code>tofu</code> takes a <code>j a</code> (so an
example type of that form would be <code>Maybe Int</code>) and returns a
<code>t a j</code>. So if we replace <code>Frank</code> with
<code>j</code>, the result type would be
<code>Frank Int Maybe</code>.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Tofu Frank where
    tofu x = Frank x</code></pre>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; tofu (Just &#39;a&#39;) :: Frank Char Maybe
Frank {frankField = Just &#39;a&#39;}
ghci&gt; tofu [&quot;HELLO&quot;] :: Frank [Char] []
Frank {frankField = [&quot;HELLO&quot;]}</code></pre>
<p>Not very useful, but we did flex our type muscles. Let’s do some more
type-foo. We have this data type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>data Barry t k p = Barry { yabba :: p, dabba :: t k }</code></pre>
<p>And now we want to make it an instance of <code>Functor</code>.
<code>Functor</code> wants types of kind <code>* -&gt; *</code> but
<code>Barry</code> doesn’t look like it has that kind. What is the kind
of <code>Barry</code>? Well, we see it takes three type parameters, so
it’s going to be
<code>something -&gt; something -&gt; something -&gt; *</code>. It’s
safe to say that <code>p</code> is a concrete type and thus has a kind
of <code>*</code>. For <code>k</code>, we assume <code>*</code> and so
by extension, <code>t</code> has a kind of <code>* -&gt; *</code>. Now
let’s just replace those kinds with the <em>somethings</em> that we used
as placeholders and we see it has a kind of
<code>(* -&gt; *) -&gt; * -&gt; * -&gt; *</code>. Let’s check that with
GHCI.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; :k Barry
Barry :: (* -&gt; *) -&gt; * -&gt; * -&gt; *</code></pre>
<p>Ah, we were right. How satisfying. Now, to make this type a part of
<code>Functor</code> we have to partially apply the first two type
parameters so that we’re left with <code>* -&gt; *</code>. That means
that the start of the instance declaration will be:
<code>instance Functor (Barry a b) where</code>. If we look at
<code>fmap</code> as if it was made specifically for <code>Barry</code>,
it would have a type of
<code>fmap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Barry c d a -&gt; Barry c d b</code>,
because we just replace the <code>Functor</code>’s <code>f</code> with
<code>Barry c d</code>. The third type parameter from <code>Barry</code>
will have to change and we see that it’s conveniently in its own
field.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Functor (Barry a b) where
    fmap f (Barry {yabba = x, dabba = y}) = Barry {yabba = f x, dabba = y}</code></pre>
<p>There we go! We just mapped the <code>f</code> over the first
field.</p>
<p>In this section, we took a good look at how type parameters work and
kind of formalized them with kinds, just like we formalized function
parameters with type declarations. We saw that there are interesting
parallels between functions and type constructors. They are, however,
two completely different things. When working on real Haskell, you
usually won’t have to mess with kinds and do kind inference by hand like
we did now. Usually, you just have to partially apply your own type to
<code>* -&gt; *</code> or <code>*</code> when making it an instance of
one of the standard typeclasses, but it’s good to know how and why that
actually works. It’s also interesting to see that types have little
types of their own. Again, you don’t really have to understand
everything we did here to read on, but if you understand how kinds work,
chances are that you have a very solid grasp of Haskell’s type
system.</p>
