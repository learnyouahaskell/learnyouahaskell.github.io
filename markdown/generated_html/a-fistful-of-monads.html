<h1 id="a-fistful-of-monads">A Fistful of Monads</h1>
<p>When we first talked about functors, we saw that they were a useful
concept for values that can be mapped over. Then, we took that concept
one step further by introducing applicative functors, which allow us to
view values of certain data types as values with contexts and use normal
functions on those values while preserving the meaning of those
contexts.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll learn about monads, which are just beefed up
applicative functors, much like applicative functors are only beefed up
functors.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/smugpig.png"
class="right" width="307" height="186" alt="more cool than u" /></p>
<p>When we started off with functors, we saw that it’s possible to map
functions over various data types. We saw that for this purpose, the
<code>Functor</code> type class was introduced and it had us asking the
question: when we have a function of type <code>a -&gt; b</code> and
some data type <code>f a</code>, how do we map that function over the
data type to end up with <code>f b</code>? We saw how to map something
over a <code>Maybe a</code>, a list <code>[a]</code>, an
<code>IO a</code> etc. We even saw how to map a function
<code>a -&gt; b</code> over other functions of type
<code>r -&gt; a</code> to get functions of type <code>r -&gt; b</code>.
To answer this question of how to map a function over some data type,
all we had to do was look at the type of <code>fmap</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>fmap :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>And then make it work for our data type by writing the appropriate
<code>Functor</code> instance.</p>
<p>Then we saw a possible improvement of functors and said, hey, what if
that function <code>a -&gt; b</code> is already wrapped inside a functor
value? Like, what if we have <code>Just (*3)</code>, how do we apply
that to <code>Just 5</code>? What if we don’t want to apply it to
<code>Just 5</code> but to a <code>Nothing</code> instead? Or if we have
<code>[(*2),(+4)]</code>, how would we apply that to
<code>[1,2,3]</code>? How would that work even? For this, the
<code>Applicative</code> type class was introduced, in which we wanted
the answer to the following type:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&lt;*&gt;) :: (Applicative f) =&gt; f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b</code></pre>
<p>We also saw that we can take a normal value and wrap it inside a data
type. For instance, we can take a <code>1</code> and wrap it so that it
becomes a <code>Just 1</code>. Or we can make it into a
<code>[1]</code>. Or an I/O action that does nothing and just yields
<code>1</code>. The function that does this is called
<code>pure</code>.</p>
<p>Like we said, an applicative value can be seen as a value with an
added context. A <em>fancy</em> value, to put it in technical terms. For
instance, the character <code>'a'</code> is just a normal character,
whereas <code>Just 'a'</code> has some added context. Instead of a
<code>Char</code>, we have a <code>Maybe Char</code>, which tells us
that its value might be a character, but it could also be an absence of
a character.</p>
<p>It was neat to see how the <code>Applicative</code> type class
allowed us to use normal functions on these values with context and how
that context was preserved. Observe:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; Just 2 &lt;*&gt; Just 8
Just 16
ghci&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; Just &quot;klingon&quot; &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; (-) &lt;$&gt; [3,4] &lt;*&gt; [1,2,3]
[2,1,0,3,2,1]</code></pre>
<p>Ah, cool, so now that we treat them as applicative values,
<code>Maybe a</code> values represent computations that might have
failed, <code>[a]</code> values represent computations that have several
results (non-deterministic computations), <code>IO a</code> values
represent values that have side-effects, etc.</p>
<p>Monads are a natural extension of applicative functors and with them
we’re concerned with this: if you have a value with a context,
<code>m a</code>, how do you apply to it a function that takes a normal
<code>a</code> and returns a value with a context? That is, how do you
apply a function of type <code>a -&gt; m b</code> to a value of type
<code>m a</code>? So essentially, we will want this function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&gt;&gt;=) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b</code></pre>
<p><strong>If we have a fancy value and a function that takes a normal
value but returns a fancy value, how do we feed that fancy value into
the function?</strong> This is the main question that we will concern
ourselves when dealing with monads. We write <code>m a</code> instead of
<code>f a</code> because the <code>m</code> stands for
<code>Monad</code>, but monads are just applicative functors that
support <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>. The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function is
pronounced as <em>bind</em>.</p>
<p>When we have a normal value <code>a</code> and a normal function
<code>a -&gt; b</code> it’s really easy to feed the value to the
function — you just apply the function to the value normally and that’s
it. But when we’re dealing with values that come with certain contexts,
it takes a bit of thinking to see how these fancy values are fed to
functions and how to take into account their behavior, but you’ll see
that it’s easy as one two three.</p>
<h2 id="getting-our-feet-wet-with-maybe">Getting our feet wet with
Maybe</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/buddha.png" class="left"
width="302" height="387" alt="monads, grasshoppa" /></p>
<p>Now that we have a vague idea of what monads are about, let’s see if
we can make that idea a bit less vague.</p>
<p>Much to no one’s surprise, <code>Maybe</code> is a monad, so let’s
explore it a bit more and see if we can combine it with what we know
about monads.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Make sure you understand <a
href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html#applicative-functors">applicatives</a>
at this point. It’s good if you have a feel for how the various
<code>Applicative</code> instances work and what kind of computations
they represent, because monads are nothing more than taking our existing
applicative knowledge and upgrading it.</p>
</div>
<p>A value of type <code>Maybe a</code> represents a value of type
<code>a</code> with the context of possible failure attached. A value of
<code>Just "dharma"</code> means that the string <code>"dharma"</code>
is there whereas a value of <code>Nothing</code> represents its absence,
or if you look at the string as the result of a computation, it means
that the computation has failed.</p>
<p>When we looked at <code>Maybe</code> as a functor, we saw that if we
want to <code>fmap</code> a function over it, it gets mapped over the
insides if it’s a <code>Just</code> value, otherwise the
<code>Nothing</code> is kept because there’s nothing to map it over!</p>
<p>Like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; fmap (++&quot;!&quot;) (Just &quot;wisdom&quot;)
Just &quot;wisdom!&quot;
ghci&gt; fmap (++&quot;!&quot;) Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>As an applicative functor, it functions similarly. However,
applicatives also have the function wrapped. <code>Maybe</code> is an
applicative functor in such a way that when we use
<code>&lt;*&gt;</code> to apply a function inside a <code>Maybe</code>
to a value that’s inside a <code>Maybe</code>, they both have to be
<code>Just</code> values for the result to be a <code>Just</code> value,
otherwise the result is <code>Nothing</code>. It makes sense because if
you’re missing either the function or the thing you’re applying it to,
you can’t make something up out of thin air, so you have to propagate
the failure:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 3
Just 6
ghci&gt; Nothing &lt;*&gt; Just &quot;greed&quot;
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just ord &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>When we use the applicative style to have normal functions act on
<code>Maybe</code> values, it’s similar. All the values have to be
<code>Just</code> values, otherwise it’s all for
<code>Nothing</code>!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; max &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 6
Just 6
ghci&gt; max &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>And now, let’s think about how we would do <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> for
<code>Maybe</code>. Like we said, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> takes a monadic
value, and a function that takes a normal value and returns a monadic
value and manages to apply that function to the monadic value. How does
it do that, if the function takes a normal value? Well, to do that, it
has to take into account the context of that monadic value.</p>
<p>In this case, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> would take a
<code>Maybe a</code> value and a function of type
<code>a -&gt; Maybe b</code> and somehow apply the function to the
<code>Maybe a</code>. To figure out how it does that, we can use the
intuition that we have from <code>Maybe</code> being an applicative
functor. Let’s say that we have a function
<code>\x -&gt; Just (x+1)</code>. It takes a number, adds <code>1</code>
to it and wraps it in a <code>Just</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+1)) 1
Just 2
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+1)) 100
Just 101</code></pre>
<p>If we feed it <code>1</code>, it evaluates to <code>Just 2</code>. If
we give it the number <code>100</code>, the result is
<code>Just 101</code>. Very straightforward. Now here’s the kicker: how
do we feed a <code>Maybe</code> value to this function? If we think
about how <code>Maybe</code> acts as an applicative functor, answering
this is pretty easy. If we feed it a <code>Just</code> value, take
what’s inside the <code>Just</code> and apply the function to it. If
give it a <code>Nothing</code>, hmm, well, then we’re left with a
function but <code>Nothing</code> to apply it to. In that case, let’s
just do what we did before and say that the result is
<code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>Instead of calling it <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, let’s call it
<code>applyMaybe</code> for now. It takes a <code>Maybe a</code> and a
function that returns a <code>Maybe b</code> and manages to apply that
function to the <code>Maybe a</code>. Here it is in code:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>applyMaybe :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
applyMaybe Nothing f  = Nothing
applyMaybe (Just x) f = f x</code></pre>
<p>Okay, now let’s play with it for a bit. We’ll use it as an infix
function so that the <code>Maybe</code> value is on the left side and
the function on the right:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just 3 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x+1)
Just 4
ghci&gt; Just &quot;smile&quot; `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x ++ &quot; :)&quot;)
Just &quot;smile :)&quot;
ghci&gt; Nothing `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x+1)
Nothing
ghci&gt; Nothing `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x ++ &quot; :)&quot;)
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, we see that when we used
<code>applyMaybe</code> with a <code>Just</code> value and a function,
the function simply got applied to the value inside the
<code>Just</code>. When we tried to use it with a <code>Nothing</code>,
the whole result was <code>Nothing</code>. What about if the function
returns a <code>Nothing</code>? Let’s see:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just 3 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; if x &gt; 2 then Just x else Nothing
Just 3
ghci&gt; Just 1 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; if x &gt; 2 then Just x else Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Just what we expected. If the monadic value on the left is a
<code>Nothing</code>, the whole thing is <code>Nothing</code>. And if
the function on the right returns a <code>Nothing</code>, the result is
<code>Nothing</code> again. This is very similar to when we used
<code>Maybe</code> as an applicative and we got a <code>Nothing</code>
result if somewhere in there was a <code>Nothing</code>.</p>
<p>It looks like that for <code>Maybe</code>, we’ve figured out how to
take a fancy value and feed it to a function that takes a normal value
and returns a fancy one. We did this by keeping in mind that a
<code>Maybe</code> value represents a computation that might have
failed.</p>
<p>You might be asking yourself, how is this useful? It may seem like
applicative functors are stronger than monads, since applicative
functors allow us to take a normal function and make it operate on
values with contexts. We’ll see that monads can do that as well because
they’re an upgrade of applicative functors, and that they can also do
some cool stuff that applicative functors can’t.</p>
<p>We’ll come back to <code>Maybe</code> in a minute, but first, let’s
check out the type class that belongs to monads.</p>
<h2 id="the-monad-type-class">The Monad type class</h2>
<p>Just like functors have the <code>Functor</code> type class and
applicative functors have the <code>Applicative</code> type class,
monads come with their own type class: <code>Monad</code>! Wow, who
would have thought? This is what the type class looks like:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Applicative m =&gt; Monad m where
    return :: a -&gt; m a
    return = pure

    (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

    (&gt;&gt;) :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
    x &gt;&gt; y = x &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; y</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/kid.png" class="right"
width="363" height="451" alt="this is you on monads" /></p>
<p>Let’s start with the first line. It says
<code>class Applicative =&gt; Monad m where</code> which means that if
we want to create an instance of Monad for some type, we must have an
instance of Applicative for that type.</p>
<p>The first function that the <code>Monad</code> type class defines is
<code>return</code>. It’s the same as <code>pure</code>, only with a
different name. Its type is <code>(Monad m) =&gt; a -&gt; m a</code>. It
takes a value and puts it in a minimal default context that still holds
that value. In other words, it takes something and wraps it in a monad.
It always does the same thing as the <code>pure</code> function from the
<code>Applicative</code> type class, which means we’re already
acquainted with <code>return</code>. We already used <code>return</code>
when doing I/O. We used it to take a value and make a bogus I/O action
that does nothing but yield that value. For <code>Maybe</code> it takes
a value and wraps it in a <code>Just</code>.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>Just a reminder: <code>return</code> is nothing like the
<code>return</code> that’s in most other languages. It doesn’t end
function execution or anything, it just takes a normal value and puts it
in a context.</p>
</div>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/tur2.png" class="left"
width="169" height="145" alt="hmmm yaes" /></p>
<p>The next function is <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, or bind. It’s like
function application, only instead of taking a normal value and feeding
it to a normal function, it takes a monadic value (that is, a value with
a context) and feeds it to a function that takes a normal value but
returns a monadic value.</p>
<p>Next up, we have <code>&gt;&gt;</code>. We won’t pay too much
attention to it for now because it comes with a default implementation
and we pretty much never implement it when making <code>Monad</code>
instances.</p>
<p>Now that we know what the <code>Monad</code> type class looks like,
let’s take a look at how <code>Maybe</code> is an instance of
<code>Monad</code>!</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monad Maybe where
    Nothing &gt;&gt;= f = Nothing
    Just x &gt;&gt;= f  = f x</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>return</code> and <code>(&gt;&gt;)</code> have <em>default
implementations</em>, so we omit them in instances. <code>return</code>
is the same as <code>pure</code>, it wraps a value in
<code>Just</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function is the same as our
<code>applyMaybe</code>. When feeding the <code>Maybe a</code> to our
function, we keep in mind the context and return a <code>Nothing</code>
if the value on the left is <code>Nothing</code> because if there’s no
value then there’s no way to apply our function to it. If it’s a
<code>Just</code> we take what’s inside and apply <code>f</code> to
it.</p>
<p>We can play around with <code>Maybe</code> as a monad:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return &quot;WHAT&quot; :: Maybe String
Just &quot;WHAT&quot;
ghci&gt; Just 9 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10)
Just 90
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10)
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Nothing new or exciting on the first line since we already used
<code>pure</code> with <code>Maybe</code> and we know that
<code>return</code> is just <code>pure</code> with a different name. The
next two lines showcase <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> a bit more.</p>
<p>Notice how when we fed <code>Just 9</code> to the function
<code>\x -&gt; return (x*10)</code>, the <code>x</code> took on the
value <code>9</code> inside the function. It seems as though we were
able to extract the value from a <code>Maybe</code> without
pattern-matching. And we still didn’t lose the context of our
<code>Maybe</code> value, because when it’s <code>Nothing</code>, the
result of using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> will be <code>Nothing</code> as
well.</p>
<h2 id="walk-the-line">Walk the line</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/pierre.png" class="left"
width="374" height="405" alt="pierre" /></p>
<p>Now that we know how to feed a <code>Maybe a</code> value to a
function of type <code>a -&gt; Maybe b</code> while taking into account
the context of possible failure, let’s see how we can use
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> repeatedly to handle computations of several
<code>Maybe a</code> values.</p>
<p>Pierre has decided to take a break from his job at the fish farm and
try tightrope walking. He’s not that bad at it, but he does have one
problem: birds keep landing on his balancing pole! They come and they
take a short rest, chat with their avian friends and then take off in
search of breadcrumbs. This wouldn’t bother him so much if the number of
birds on the left side of the pole was always equal to the number of
birds on the right side. But sometimes, all the birds decide that they
like one side better and so they throw him off balance, which results in
an embarrassing tumble for Pierre (he’s using a safety net).</p>
<p>Let’s say that he keeps his balance if the number of birds on the
left side of the pole and on the right side of the pole is within three.
So if there’s one bird on the right side and four birds on the left
side, he’s okay. But if a fifth bird lands on the left side, then he
loses his balance and takes a dive.</p>
<p>We’re going to simulate birds landing on and flying away from the
pole and see if Pierre is still at it after a certain number of birdy
arrivals and departures. For instance, we want to see what happens to
Pierre if first one bird arrives on the left side, then four birds
occupy the right side and then the bird that was on the left side
decides to fly away.</p>
<p>We can represent the pole with a simple pair of integers. The first
component will signify the number of birds on the left side and the
second component the number of birds on the right side:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type Birds = Int
type Pole = (Birds,Birds)</code></pre>
<p>First we made a type synonym for <code>Int</code>, called
<code>Birds</code>, because we’re using integers to represent how many
birds there are. And then we made a type synonym
<code>(Birds,Birds)</code> and we called it <code>Pole</code> (not to be
confused with a person of Polish descent).</p>
<p>Next up, how about we make a function that takes a number of birds
and lands them on one side of the pole. Here are the functions:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>landLeft :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Pole
landLeft n (left,right) = (left + n,right)

landRight :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Pole
landRight n (left,right) = (left,right + n)</code></pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward stuff. Let’s try them out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (0,0)
(2,0)
ghci&gt; landRight 1 (1,2)
(1,3)
ghci&gt; landRight (-1) (1,2)
(1,1)</code></pre>
<p>To make birds fly away we just had a negative number of birds land on
one side. Because landing a bird on the <code>Pole</code> returns a
<code>Pole</code>, we can chain applications of <code>landLeft</code>
and <code>landRight</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0)))
(3,1)</code></pre>
<p>When we apply the function <code>landLeft 1</code> to
<code>(0,0)</code> we get <code>(1,0)</code>. Then, we land a bird on
the right side, resulting in <code>(1,1)</code>. Finally two birds land
on the left side, resulting in <code>(3,1)</code>. We apply a function
to something by first writing the function and then writing its
parameter, but here it would be better if the pole went first and then
the landing function. If we make a function like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>x -: f = f x</code></pre>
<p>We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the
function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; 100 -: (*3)
300
ghci&gt; True -: not
False
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 2
(2,0)</code></pre>
<p>By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more
readable manner:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2
(3,1)</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool! This example is equivalent to the one before where we
repeatedly landed birds on the pole, only it looks neater. Here, it’s
more obvious that we start off with <code>(0,0)</code> and then land one
bird one the left, then one on the right and finally two on the
left.</p>
<p>So far so good, but what happens if 10 birds land on one side?</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; landLeft 10 (0,3)
(10,3)</code></pre>
<p>10 birds on the left side and only 3 on the right? That’s sure to
send poor Pierre falling through the air! This is pretty obvious here
but what if we had a sequence of landings like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 4 -: landLeft (-1) -: landRight (-2)
(0,2)</code></pre>
<p>It might seem like everything is okay but if you follow the steps
here, you’ll see that at one time there are 4 birds on the right side
and no birds on the left! To fix this, we have to take another look at
our <code>landLeft</code> and <code>landRight</code> functions. From
what we’ve seen, we want these functions to be able to fail. That is, we
want them to return a new pole if the balance is okay but fail if the
birds land in a lopsided manner. And what better way to add a context of
failure to value than by using <code>Maybe</code>! Let’s rework these
functions:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>landLeft :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
landLeft n (left,right)
    | abs ((left + n) - right) &lt; 4 = Just (left + n, right)
    | otherwise                    = Nothing

landRight :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
landRight n (left,right)
    | abs (left - (right + n)) &lt; 4 = Just (left, right + n)
    | otherwise                    = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Instead of returning a <code>Pole</code> these functions now return a
<code>Maybe Pole</code>. They still take the number of birds and the old
pole as before, but then they check if landing that many birds on the
pole would throw Pierre off balance. We use guards to check if the
difference between the number of birds on the new pole is less than 4.
If it is, we wrap the new pole in a <code>Just</code> and return that.
If it isn’t, we return a <code>Nothing</code>, indicating failure.</p>
<p>Let’s give these babies a go:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (0,0)
Just (2,0)
ghci&gt; landLeft 10 (0,3)
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Nice! When we land birds without throwing Pierre off balance, we get
a new pole wrapped in a <code>Just</code>. But when many more birds end
up on one side of the pole, we get a <code>Nothing</code>. This is cool,
but we seem to have lost the ability to repeatedly land birds on the
pole. We can’t do <code>landLeft 1 (landRight 1 (0,0))</code> anymore
because when we apply <code>landRight 1</code> to <code>(0,0)</code>, we
don’t get a <code>Pole</code>, but a <code>Maybe Pole</code>.
<code>landLeft 1</code> takes a <code>Pole</code> and not a
<code>Maybe Pole</code>.</p>
<p>We need a way of taking a <code>Maybe Pole</code> and feeding it to a
function that takes a <code>Pole</code> and returns a
<code>Maybe Pole</code>. Luckily, we have <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, which
does just that for <code>Maybe</code>. Let’s give it a go:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; landRight 1 (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2
Just (2,1)</code></pre>
<p>Remember, <code>landLeft 2</code> has a type of
<code>Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole</code>. We couldn’t just feed it the
<code>Maybe Pole</code> that is the result of
<code>landRight 1 (0,0)</code>, so we use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to take
that value with a context and give it to <code>landLeft 2</code>.
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> does indeed allow us to treat the
<code>Maybe</code> value as a value with context because if we feed a
<code>Nothing</code> into <code>landLeft 2</code>, the result is
<code>Nothing</code> and the failure is propagated:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>With this, we can now chain landings that may fail because
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> allows us to feed a monadic value to a function
that takes a normal one.</p>
<p>Here’s a sequence of birdy landings:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2 &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2 &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)</code></pre>
<p>At the beginning, we used <code>return</code> to take a pole and wrap
it in a <code>Just</code>. We could have just applied
<code>landRight 2</code> to <code>(0,0)</code>, it would have been the
same, but this way we can be more consistent by using
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> for every function. <code>Just (0,0)</code> gets
fed to <code>landRight 2</code>, resulting in <code>Just (0,2)</code>.
This, in turn, gets fed to <code>landLeft 2</code>, resulting in
<code>Just (2,2)</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>Remember this example from before we introduced failure into Pierre’s
routine:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 4 -: landLeft (-1) -: landRight (-2)
(0,2)</code></pre>
<p>It didn’t simulate his interaction with birds very well because in
the middle there his balance was off but the result didn’t reflect that.
But let’s give that a go now by using monadic application
(<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) instead of normal application:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt;= landRight 4 &gt;&gt;= landLeft (-1) &gt;&gt;= landRight (-2)
Nothing</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/banana.png" class="right"
width="262" height="130" alt="iama banana" /></p>
<p>Awesome. The final result represents failure, which is what we
expected. Let’s see how this result was obtained. First,
<code>return</code> puts <code>(0,0)</code> into a default context,
making it a <code>Just (0,0)</code>. Then,
<code>Just (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1</code> happens. Since the
<code>Just (0,0)</code> is a <code>Just</code> value,
<code>landLeft 1</code> gets applied to <code>(0,0)</code>, resulting in
a <code>Just (1,0)</code>, because the birds are still relatively
balanced. Next, <code>Just (1,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 4</code> takes
place and the result is <code>Just (1,4)</code> as the balance of the
birds is still intact, although just barely. <code>Just (1,4)</code>
gets fed to <code>landLeft (-1)</code>. This means that
<code>landLeft (-1) (1,4)</code> takes place. Now because of how
<code>landLeft</code> works, this results in a <code>Nothing</code>,
because the resulting pole is off balance. Now that we have a
<code>Nothing</code>, it gets fed to <code>landRight (-2)</code>, but
because it’s a <code>Nothing</code>, the result is automatically
<code>Nothing</code>, as we have nothing to apply
<code>landRight (-2)</code> to.</p>
<p>We couldn’t have achieved this by just using <code>Maybe</code> as an
applicative. If you try it, you’ll get stuck, because applicative
functors don’t allow for the applicative values to interact with each
other very much. They can, at best, be used as parameters to a function
by using the applicative style. The applicative operators will fetch
their results and feed them to the function in a manner appropriate for
each applicative and then put the final applicative value together, but
there isn’t that much interaction going on between them. Here, however,
each step relies on the previous one’s result. On every landing, the
possible result from the previous one is examined and the pole is
checked for balance. This determines whether the landing will succeed or
fail.</p>
<p>We may also devise a function that ignores the current number of
birds on the balancing pole and just makes Pierre slip and fall. We can
call it <code>banana</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>banana :: Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
banana _ = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>Now we can chain it together with our bird landings. It will always
cause our walker to fall, because it ignores whatever’s passed to it and
always returns a failure. Check it:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt;= banana &gt;&gt;= landRight 1
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>The value <code>Just (1,0)</code> gets fed to <code>banana</code>,
but it produces a <code>Nothing</code>, which causes everything to
result in a <code>Nothing</code>. How unfortunate!</p>
<p>Instead of making functions that ignore their input and just return a
predetermined monadic value, we can use the <code>&gt;&gt;</code>
function, whose default implementation is this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&gt;&gt;) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
m &gt;&gt; n = m &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; n</code></pre>
<p>Normally, passing some value to a function that ignores its parameter
and always just returns some predetermined value would always result in
that predetermined value. With monads however, their context and meaning
has to be considered as well. Here’s how <code>&gt;&gt;</code> acts with
<code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt; Just 3
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt; Just 4
Just 4
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt; Nothing
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>If you replace <code>&gt;&gt;</code> with
<code>&gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt;</code>, it’s easy to see why it acts like it
does.</p>
<p>We can replace our <code>banana</code> function in the chain with a
<code>&gt;&gt;</code> and then a <code>Nothing</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= landRight 1
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>There we go, guaranteed and obvious failure!</p>
<p>It’s also worth taking a look at what this would look like if we
hadn’t made the clever choice of treating <code>Maybe</code> values as
values with a failure context and feeding them to functions like we did.
Here’s how a series of bird landings would look like:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = case landLeft 1 (0,0) of
    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
    Just pole1 -&gt; case landRight 4 pole1 of
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just pole2 -&gt; case landLeft 2 pole2 of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just pole3 -&gt; landLeft 1 pole3</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/centaur.png"
class="right" width="297" height="331" alt="john joe glanton" /></p>
<p>We land a bird on the left and then we examine the possibility of
failure and the possibility of success. In the case of failure, we
return a <code>Nothing</code>. In the case of success, we land birds on
the right and then do the same thing all over again. Converting this
monstrosity into a neat chain of monadic applications with
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is a classic example of how the
<code>Maybe</code> monad saves us a lot of time when we have to
successively do computations that are based on computations that might
have failed.</p>
<p>Notice how the <code>Maybe</code> implementation of
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> features exactly this logic of seeing if a value
is <code>Nothing</code> and if it is, returning a <code>Nothing</code>
right away and if it isn’t, going forward with what’s inside the
<code>Just</code>.</p>
<p>In this section, we took some functions that we had and saw that they
would work better if the values that they returned supported failure. By
turning those values into <code>Maybe</code> values and replacing normal
function application with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, we got a mechanism for
handling failure pretty much for free, because <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is
supposed to preserve the context of the value to which it applies
functions. In this case, the context was that our values were values
with failure and so when we applied functions to such values, the
possibility of failure was always taken into account.</p>
<h2 id="do-notation">do notation</h2>
<p>Monads in Haskell are so useful that they got their own special
syntax called <code>do</code> notation. We’ve already encountered
<code>do</code> notation when we were doing I/O and there we said that
it was for gluing together several I/O actions into one. Well, as it
turns out, <code>do</code> notation isn’t just for <code>IO</code>, but
can be used for any monad. Its principle is still the same: gluing
together monadic values in sequence. We’re going to take a look at how
<code>do</code> notation works and why it’s useful.</p>
<p>Consider this familiar example of monadic application:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (show x ++ &quot;!&quot;))
Just &quot;3!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Been there, done that. Feeding a monadic value to a function that
returns one, no big deal. Notice how when we do this, <code>x</code>
becomes <code>3</code> inside the lambda. Once we’re inside that lambda,
it’s just a normal value rather than a monadic value. Now, what if we
had another <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> inside that function? Check this
out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just &quot;!&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Just &quot;3!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Ah, a nested use of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>! In the outermost lambda,
we feed <code>Just "!"</code> to the lambda
<code>\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)</code>. Inside this lambda, the
<code>y</code> becomes <code>"!"</code>. <code>x</code> is still
<code>3</code> because we got it from the outer lambda. All this sort of
reminds me of the following expression:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let x = 3; y = &quot;!&quot; in show x ++ y
&quot;3!&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The main difference between these two is that the values in the
former example are monadic. They’re values with a failure context. We
can replace any of them with a failure:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just &quot;!&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just &quot;!&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Nothing))
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>In the first line, feeding a <code>Nothing</code> to a function
naturally results in a <code>Nothing</code>. In the second line, we feed
<code>Just 3</code> to a function and the <code>x</code> becomes
<code>3</code>, but then we feed a <code>Nothing</code> to the inner
lambda and the result of that is <code>Nothing</code>, which causes the
outer lambda to produce <code>Nothing</code> as well. So this is sort of
like assigning values to variables in <code>let</code> expressions, only
that the values in question are monadic values.</p>
<p>To further illustrate this point, let’s write this in a script and
have each <code>Maybe</code> value take up its own line:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foo :: Maybe String
foo = Just 3   &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt;
      Just &quot;!&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt;
      Just (show x ++ y)))</code></pre>
<p>To save us from writing all these annoying lambdas, Haskell gives us
<code>do</code> notation. It allows us to write the previous piece of
code like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>foo :: Maybe String
foo = do
    x &lt;- Just 3
    y &lt;- Just &quot;!&quot;
    Just (show x ++ y)</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/owld.png" class="right"
width="269" height="348" alt="90s owl" /></p>
<p>It would seem as though we’ve gained the ability to temporarily
extract things from <code>Maybe</code> values without having to check if
the <code>Maybe</code> values are <code>Just</code> values or
<code>Nothing</code> values at every step. How cool! If any of the
values that we try to extract from are <code>Nothing</code>, the whole
<code>do</code> expression will result in a <code>Nothing</code>. We’re
yanking out their (possibly existing) values and letting
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> worry about the context that comes with those
values. It’s important to remember that <code>do</code> expressions are
just different syntax for chaining monadic values.</p>
<p>In a <code>do</code> expression, every line is a monadic value. To
inspect its result, we use <code>&lt;-</code>. If we have a
<code>Maybe String</code> and we bind it with <code>&lt;-</code> to a
variable, that variable will be a <code>String</code>, just like when we
used <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed monadic values to lambdas. The last
monadic value in a <code>do</code> expression, like
<code>Just (show x ++ y)</code> here, can’t be used with
<code>&lt;-</code> to bind its result, because that wouldn’t make sense
if we translated the <code>do</code> expression back to a chain of
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> applications. Rather, its result is the result of
the whole glued up monadic value, taking into account the possible
failure of any of the previous ones.</p>
<p>For instance, examine the following line:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just 9 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (x &gt; 8))
Just True</code></pre>
<p>Because the left parameter of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is a
<code>Just</code> value, the lambda is applied to <code>9</code> and the
result is a <code>Just True</code>. If we rewrite this in
<code>do</code> notation, we get:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>marySue :: Maybe Bool
marySue = do
    x &lt;- Just 9
    Just (x &gt; 8)</code></pre>
<p>If we compare these two, it’s easy to see why the result of the whole
monadic value is the result of the last monadic value in the
<code>do</code> expression with all the previous ones chained into
it.</p>
<p>Our tightwalker’s routine can also be expressed with <code>do</code>
notation. <code>landLeft</code> and <code>landRight</code> take a number
of birds and a pole and produce a pole wrapped in a <code>Just</code>,
unless the tightwalker slips, in which case a <code>Nothing</code> is
produced. We used <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to chain successive steps
because each one relied on the previous one and each one had an added
context of possible failure. Here’s two birds landing on the left side,
then two birds landing on the right and then one bird landing on the
left:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = do
    start &lt;- return (0,0)
    first &lt;- landLeft 2 start
    second &lt;- landRight 2 first
    landLeft 1 second</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see if he succeeds:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; routine
Just (3,2)</code></pre>
<p>He does! Great. When we were doing these routines by explicitly
writing <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, we usually said something like
<code>return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2</code>, because
<code>landLeft 2</code> is a function that returns a <code>Maybe</code>
value. With <code>do</code> expressions however, each line must feature
a monadic value. So we explicitly pass the previous <code>Pole</code> to
the <code>landLeft</code> <code>landRight</code> functions. If we
examined the variables to which we bound our <code>Maybe</code> values,
<code>start</code> would be <code>(0,0)</code>, <code>first</code> would
be <code>(2,0)</code> and so on.</p>
<p>Because <code>do</code> expressions are written line by line, they
may look like imperative code to some people. But the thing is, they’re
just sequential, as each value in each line relies on the result of the
previous ones, along with their contexts (in this case, whether they
succeeded or failed).</p>
<p>Again, let’s take a look at what this piece of code would look like
if we hadn’t used the monadic aspects of <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>routine :: Maybe Pole
routine =
    case Just (0,0) of
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just start -&gt; case landLeft 2 start of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just first -&gt; case landRight 2 first of
                Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                Just second -&gt; landLeft 1 second</code></pre>
<p>See how in the case of success, the tuple inside
<code>Just (0,0)</code> becomes <code>start</code>, the result of
<code>landLeft 2 start</code> becomes <code>first</code>, etc.</p>
<p>If we want to throw the Pierre a banana peel in <code>do</code>
notation, we can do the following:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = do
    start &lt;- return (0,0)
    first &lt;- landLeft 2 start
    Nothing
    second &lt;- landRight 2 first
    landLeft 1 second</code></pre>
<p>When we write a line in <code>do</code> notation without binding the
monadic value with <code>&lt;-</code>, it’s just like putting
<code>&gt;&gt;</code> after the monadic value whose result we want to
ignore. We sequence the monadic value but we ignore its result because
we don’t care what it is and it’s prettier than writing
<code>_ &lt;- Nothing</code>, which is equivalent to the above.</p>
<p>When to use <code>do</code> notation and when to explicitly use
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is up to you. I think this example lends itself
to explicitly writing <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> because each step relies
specifically on the result of the previous one. With <code>do</code>
notation, we had to specifically write on which pole the birds are
landing, but every time we used that came directly before. But still, it
gave us some insight into <code>do</code> notation.</p>
<p>In <code>do</code> notation, when we bind monadic values to names, we
can utilize pattern matching, just like in <code>let</code> expressions
and function parameters. Here’s an example of pattern matching in a
<code>do</code> expression:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>justH :: Maybe Char
justH = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- Just &quot;hello&quot;
    return x</code></pre>
<p>We use pattern matching to get the first character of the string
<code>"hello"</code> and then we present it as the result. So
<code>justH</code> evaluates to <code>Just 'h'</code>.</p>
<p>What if this pattern matching were to fail? When matching on a
pattern in a function fails, the next pattern is matched. If the
matching falls through all the patterns for a given function, an error
is thrown and our program crashes. On the other hand, failed pattern
matching in <code>let</code> expressions results in an error being
produced right away, because the mechanism of falling through patterns
isn’t present in <code>let</code> expressions. When pattern matching
fails in a <code>do</code> expression, the <code>fail</code> function is
called. It’s part of the <code>MonadFail</code> type class and it
enables failed pattern matching to result in a failure in the context of
the current monad instead of making our program crash.</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Monad m =&gt; MonadFail m where
    fail :: String -&gt; m a</code></pre>
<p>Monads that incorporate a context of possible failure (like
<code>Maybe</code>) usually implement it. For <code>Maybe</code>, its
implemented like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance MonadFail Maybe where
    fail _ = Nothing</code></pre>
<p>It ignores the error message and makes a <code>Nothing</code>. So
when pattern matching fails in a <code>Maybe</code> value that’s written
in <code>do</code> notation, the whole value results in a
<code>Nothing</code>. This is preferable to having our program crash.
Here’s a <code>do</code> expression with a pattern that’s bound to
fail:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>wopwop :: Maybe Char
wopwop = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- Just &quot;&quot;
    return x</code></pre>
<p>The pattern matching fails, so the effect is the same as if the whole
line with the pattern was replaced with a <code>Nothing</code>. Let’s
try this out:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; wopwop
Nothing</code></pre>
<p>The failed pattern matching has caused a failure within the context
of our monad instead of causing a program-wide failure, which is pretty
neat.</p>
<h2 id="the-list-monad">The list monad</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/deadcat.png" class="left"
width="235" height="230" alt="dead cat" /></p>
<p>So far, we’ve seen how <code>Maybe</code> values can be viewed as
values with a failure context and how we can incorporate failure
handling into our code by using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed them to
functions. In this section, we’re going to take a look at how to use the
monadic aspects of lists to bring non-determinism into our code in a
clear and readable manner.</p>
<p>We’ve already talked about how lists represent non-deterministic
values when they’re used as applicatives. A value like <code>5</code> is
deterministic. It has only one result and we know exactly what it is. On
the other hand, a value like <code>[3,8,9]</code> contains several
results, so we can view it as one value that is actually many values at
the same time. Using lists as applicative functors showcases this
non-determinism nicely:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt; [10,100,1000]
[10,100,1000,20,200,2000,30,300,3000]</code></pre>
<p>All the possible combinations of multiplying elements from the left
list with elements from the right list are included in the resulting
list. When dealing with non-determinism, there are many choices that we
can make, so we just try all of them, and so the result is a
non-deterministic value as well, only it has many more results.</p>
<p>This context of non-determinism translates to monads very nicely.
Let’s go ahead and see what the <code>Monad</code> instance for lists
looks like:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Monad [] where
    xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)</code></pre>
<p><code>return</code> does the same thing as <code>pure</code>, so we
should already be familiar with <code>return</code> for lists. It takes
a value and puts it in a minimal default context that still yields that
value. In other words, it makes a list that has only that one value as
its result. This is useful for when we want to just wrap a normal value
into a list so that it can interact with non-deterministic values.</p>
<p>To understand how <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> works for lists, it’s best
if we take a look at it in action to gain some intuition first.
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is about taking a value with a context (a monadic
value) and feeding it to a function that takes a normal value and
returns one that has context. If that function just produced a normal
value instead of one with a context, <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> wouldn’t be
so useful because after one use, the context would be lost. Anyway,
let’s try feeding a non-deterministic value to a function:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [3,4,5] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; [x,-x]
[3,-3,4,-4,5,-5]</code></pre>
<p>When we used <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> with <code>Maybe</code>, the
monadic value was fed into the function while taking care of possible
failures. Here, it takes care of non-determinism for us.
<code>[3,4,5]</code> is a non-deterministic value and we feed it into a
function that returns a non-deterministic value as well. The result is
also non-deterministic, and it features all the possible results of
taking elements from the list <code>[3,4,5]</code> and passing them to
the function <code>\x -&gt; [x,-x]</code>. This function takes a number
and produces two results: one negated and one that’s unchanged. So when
we use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed this list to the function, every
number is negated and also kept unchanged. The <code>x</code> from the
lambda takes on every value from the list that’s fed to it.</p>
<p>To see how this is achieved, we can just follow the implementation.
First, we start off with the list <code>[3,4,5]</code>. Then, we map the
lambda over it and the result is the following:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>[[3,-3],[4,-4],[5,-5]]</code></pre>
<p>The lambda is applied to every element and we get a list of lists.
Finally, we just flatten the list and voila! We’ve applied a
non-deterministic function to a non-deterministic value!</p>
<p>Non-determinism also includes support for failure. The empty list
<code>[]</code> is pretty much the equivalent of <code>Nothing</code>,
because it signifies the absence of a result. That’s why failing is just
defined as the empty list. The error message gets thrown away. Let’s
play around with lists that fail:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; [&quot;bad&quot;,&quot;mad&quot;,&quot;rad&quot;]
[]
ghci&gt; [1,2,3] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; []
[]</code></pre>
<p>In the first line, an empty list is fed into the lambda. Because the
list has no elements, none of them can be passed to the function and so
the result is an empty list. This is similar to feeding
<code>Nothing</code> to a function. In the second line, each element
gets passed to the function, but the element is ignored and the function
just returns an empty list. Because the function fails for every element
that goes in it, the result is a failure.</p>
<p>Just like with <code>Maybe</code> values, we can chain several lists
with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, propagating the non-determinism:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [1,2] &gt;&gt;= \n -&gt; [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;] &gt;&gt;= \ch -&gt; return (n,ch)
[(1,&#39;a&#39;),(1,&#39;b&#39;),(2,&#39;a&#39;),(2,&#39;b&#39;)]</code></pre>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/concatmap.png"
class="left" width="399" height="340" alt="concatmap" /></p>
<p>The list <code>[1,2]</code> gets bound to <code>n</code> and
<code>['a','b']</code> gets bound to <code>ch</code>. Then, we do
<code>return (n,ch)</code> (or <code>[(n,ch)]</code>), which means
taking a pair of <code>(n,ch)</code> and putting it in a default minimal
context. In this case, it’s making the smallest possible list that still
presents <code>(n,ch)</code> as the result and features as little
non-determinism as possible. Its effect on the context is minimal. What
we’re saying here is this: for every element in <code>[1,2]</code>, go
over every element in <code>['a','b']</code> and produce a tuple of one
element from each list.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, because <code>return</code> takes a value and
wraps it in a minimal context, it doesn’t have any extra effect (like
failing in <code>Maybe</code> or resulting in more non-determinism for
lists) but it does present something as its result.</p>
<div class="hintbox">
<p>When you have non-deterministic values interacting, you can view
their computation as a tree where every possible result in a list
represents a separate branch.</p>
</div>
<p>Here’s the previous expression rewritten in <code>do</code>
notation:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>listOfTuples :: [(Int,Char)]
listOfTuples = do
    n &lt;- [1,2]
    ch &lt;- [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;]
    return (n,ch)</code></pre>
<p>This makes it a bit more obvious that <code>n</code> takes on every
value from <code>[1,2]</code> and <code>ch</code> takes on every value
from <code>['a','b']</code>. Just like with <code>Maybe</code>, we’re
extracting the elements from the monadic values and treating them like
normal values and <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> takes care of the context for
us. The context in this case is non-determinism.</p>
<p>Using lists with <code>do</code> notation really reminds me of
something we’ve seen before. Check out the following piece of code:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [ (n,ch) | n &lt;- [1,2], ch &lt;- [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;] ]
[(1,&#39;a&#39;),(1,&#39;b&#39;),(2,&#39;a&#39;),(2,&#39;b&#39;)]</code></pre>
<p>Yes! List comprehensions! In our <code>do</code> notation example,
<code>n</code> became every result from <code>[1,2]</code> and for every
such result, <code>ch</code> was assigned a result from
<code>['a','b']</code> and then the final line put <code>(n,ch)</code>
into a default context (a singleton list) to present it as the result
without introducing any additional non-determinism. In this list
comprehension, the same thing happened, only we didn’t have to write
<code>return</code> at the end to present <code>(n,ch)</code> as the
result because the output part of a list comprehension did that for
us.</p>
<p>In fact, list comprehensions are just syntactic sugar for using lists
as monads. In the end, list comprehensions and lists in <code>do</code>
notation translate to using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to do computations
that feature non-determinism.</p>
<p>List comprehensions allow us to filter our output. For instance, we
can filter a list of numbers to search only for that numbers whose
digits contain a <code>7</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [ x | x &lt;- [1..50], &#39;7&#39; `elem` show x ]
[7,17,27,37,47]</code></pre>
<p>We apply <code>show</code> to <code>x</code> to turn our number into
a string and then we check if the character <code>'7'</code> is part of
that string. Pretty clever. To see how filtering in list comprehensions
translates to the list monad, we have to check out the
<code>guard</code> function and the <code>Alternative</code> type class.
The <code>Alternative</code> type class is for Applicatives that can
also act as monoids. Here’s its definition:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>class Applicative f =&gt; Alternative f where
    empty :: f a
    (&lt;|&gt;) :: f a -&gt; f a -&gt; f a</code></pre>
<p><code>empty</code> is synonymous to <code>mempty</code> from the
<code>Monoid</code> type class and <code>(&lt;|&gt;)</code> corresponds
to <code>mappend</code>. Because lists are monoids as well as monads,
they can be made an instance of this type class:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>instance Alternative [] where
    empty = []
    (&lt;|&gt;) = (++)</code></pre>
<p>For lists <code>empty</code> represents a non-deterministic
computation that has no results at all — a failed computation.
<code>(&lt;|&gt;)</code> joins two non-deterministic values into one.
The <code>guard</code> function is defined like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>guard :: (Alternative m) =&gt; Bool -&gt; m ()
guard True = pure ()
guard False = empty</code></pre>
<p>It takes a boolean value and if it’s <code>True</code>, takes a
<code>()</code> and puts it in a minimal default context that still
succeeds. Otherwise, it makes a failed monadic value. Here it is in
action:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) :: Maybe ()
Just ()
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) :: Maybe ()
Nothing
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) :: [()]
[()]
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) :: [()]
[]</code></pre>
<p>Looks interesting, but how is it useful? In the list monad, we use it
to filter out non-deterministic computations. Observe:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [1..50] &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; guard (&#39;7&#39; `elem` show x) &gt;&gt; return x)
[7,17,27,37,47]</code></pre>
<p>The result here is the same as the result of our previous list
comprehension. How does <code>guard</code> achieve this? Let’s first see
how <code>guard</code> functions in conjunction with
<code>&gt;&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) &gt;&gt; return &quot;cool&quot; :: [String]
[&quot;cool&quot;]
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) &gt;&gt; return &quot;cool&quot; :: [String]
[]</code></pre>
<p>If <code>guard</code> succeeds, the result contained within it is an
empty tuple. So then, we use <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to ignore that empty
tuple and present something else as the result. However, if
<code>guard</code> fails, then so will the <code>return</code> later on,
because feeding an empty list to a function with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>
always results in an empty list. A <code>guard</code> basically says: if
this boolean is <code>False</code> then produce a failure right here,
otherwise make a successful value that has a dummy result of
<code>()</code> inside it. All this does is to allow the computation to
continue.</p>
<p>Here’s the previous example rewritten in <code>do</code>
notation:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>sevensOnly :: [Int]
sevensOnly = do
    x &lt;- [1..50]
    guard (&#39;7&#39; `elem` show x)
    return x</code></pre>
<p>Had we forgotten to present <code>x</code> as the final result by
using <code>return</code>, the resulting list would just be a list of
empty tuples. Here’s this again in the form of a list comprehension:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; [ x | x &lt;- [1..50], &#39;7&#39; `elem` show x ]
[7,17,27,37,47]</code></pre>
<p>So filtering in list comprehensions is the same as using
<code>guard</code>.</p>
<h3 id="a-knights-quest">A knight’s quest</h3>
<p>Here’s a problem that really lends itself to being solved with
non-determinism. Say you have a chess board and only one knight piece on
it. We want to find out if the knight can reach a certain position in
three moves. We’ll just use a pair of numbers to represent the knight’s
position on the chess board. The first number will determine the column
he’s in and the second number will determine the row.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/chess.png" class="center"
width="760" height="447" alt="hee haw im a horse" /></p>
<p>Let’s make a type synonym for the knight’s current position on the
chess board:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>type KnightPos = (Int,Int)</code></pre>
<p>So let’s say that the knight starts at <code>(6,2)</code>. Can he get
to <code>(6,1)</code> in exactly three moves? Let’s see. If we start off
at <code>(6,2)</code> what’s the best move to make next? I know, how
about all of them! We have non-determinism at our disposal, so instead
of picking one move, let’s just pick all of them at once. Here’s a
function that takes the knight’s position and returns all of its next
moves:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>moveKnight :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
moveKnight (c,r) = do
    (c&#39;,r&#39;) &lt;- [(c+2,r-1),(c+2,r+1),(c-2,r-1),(c-2,r+1)
               ,(c+1,r-2),(c+1,r+2),(c-1,r-2),(c-1,r+2)
               ]
    guard (c&#39; `elem` [1..8] &amp;&amp; r&#39; `elem` [1..8])
    return (c&#39;,r&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>The knight can always take one step horizontally or vertically and
two steps horizontally or vertically but its movement has to be both
horizontal and vertical. <code>(c',r')</code> takes on every value from
the list of movements and then <code>guard</code> makes sure that the
new move, <code>(c',r')</code> is still on the board. If it it’s not, it
produces an empty list, which causes a failure and
<code>return (c',r')</code> isn’t carried out for that position.</p>
<p>This function can also be written without the use of lists as a
monad, but we did it here just for kicks. Here is the same function done
with <code>filter</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>moveKnight :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
moveKnight (c,r) = filter onBoard
    [(c+2,r-1),(c+2,r+1),(c-2,r-1),(c-2,r+1)
    ,(c+1,r-2),(c+1,r+2),(c-1,r-2),(c-1,r+2)
    ]
    where onBoard (c,r) = c `elem` [1..8] &amp;&amp; r `elem` [1..8]</code></pre>
<p>Both of these do the same thing, so pick one that you think looks
nicer. Let’s give it a whirl:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; moveKnight (6,2)
[(8,1),(8,3),(4,1),(4,3),(7,4),(5,4)]
ghci&gt; moveKnight (8,1)
[(6,2),(7,3)]</code></pre>
<p>Works like a charm! We take one position and we just carry out all
the possible moves at once, so to speak. So now that we have a
non-deterministic next position, we just use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to
feed it to <code>moveKnight</code>. Here’s a function that takes a
position and returns all the positions that you can reach from it in
three moves:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>in3 :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
in3 start = do
    first &lt;- moveKnight start
    second &lt;- moveKnight first
    moveKnight second</code></pre>
<p>If you pass it <code>(6,2)</code>, the resulting list is quite big,
because if there are several ways to reach some position in three moves,
it crops up in the list several times. The above without <code>do</code>
notation:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>in3 start = return start &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> once gives us all possible moves from
the start and then when we use <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> the second time,
for every possible first move, every possible next move is computed, and
the same goes for the last move.</p>
<p>Putting a value in a default context by applying <code>return</code>
to it and then feeding it to a function with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is
the same as just normally applying the function to that value, but we
did it here anyway for style.</p>
<p>Now, let’s make a function that takes two positions and tells us if
you can get from one to the other in exactly three steps:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>canReachIn3 :: KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn3 start end = end `elem` in3 start</code></pre>
<p>We generate all the possible positions in three steps and then we see
if the position we’re looking for is among them. So let’s see if we can
get from <code>(6,2)</code> to <code>(6,1)</code> in three moves:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (6,2) `canReachIn3` (6,1)
True</code></pre>
<p>Yes! How about from <code>(6,2)</code> to <code>(7,3)</code>?</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; (6,2) `canReachIn3` (7,3)
False</code></pre>
<p>No! As an exercise, you can change this function so that when you can
reach one position from the other, it tells you which moves to take.
Later on, we’ll see how to modify this function so that we also pass it
the number of moves to take instead of that number being hardcoded like
it is now.</p>
<h2 id="monad-laws">Monad laws</h2>
<p><img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/judgedog.png"
class="right" width="343" height="170"
alt="the court finds you guilty of peeing all over everything" /></p>
<p>Just like applicative functors, and functors before them, monads come
with a few laws that all monad instances must abide by. Just because
something is made an instance of the <code>Monad</code> type class
doesn’t mean that it’s a monad, it just means that it was made an
instance of a type class. For a type to truly be a monad, the monad laws
must hold for that type. These laws allow us to make reasonable
assumptions about the type and its behavior.</p>
<p>Haskell allows any type to be an instance of any type class as long
as the types check out. It can’t check if the monad laws hold for a type
though, so if we’re making a new instance of the <code>Monad</code> type
class, we have to be reasonably sure that all is well with the monad
laws for that type. We can rely on the types that come with the standard
library to satisfy the laws, but later when we go about making our own
monads, we’re going to have to manually check the if the laws hold. But
don’t worry, they’re not complicated.</p>
<h3 id="left-identity">Left identity</h3>
<p>The first monad law states that if we take a value, put it in a
default context with <code>return</code> and then feed it to a function
by using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, it’s the same as just taking the value
and applying the function to it. To put it formally:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="label law">return x &gt;&gt;= f</code> is the same damn
thing as <code class="label law">f x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at monadic values as values with a context and
<code>return</code> as taking a value and putting it in a default
minimal context that still presents that value as its result, it makes
sense, because if that context is really minimal, feeding this monadic
value to a function shouldn’t be much different than just applying the
function to the normal value, and indeed it isn’t different at all.</p>
<p>For the <code>Maybe</code> monad <code>return</code> is defined as
<code>Just</code>. The <code>Maybe</code> monad is all about possible
failure, and if we have a value and want to put it in such a context, it
makes sense that we treat it as a successful computation because, well,
we know what the value is. Here’s some <code>return</code> usage with
<code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (x+100000))
Just 100003
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+100000)) 3
Just 100003</code></pre>
<p>For the list monad <code>return</code> puts something in a singleton
list. The <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> implementation for lists goes over all
the values in the list and applies the function to them, but since
there’s only one value in a singleton list, it’s the same as applying
the function to that value:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return &quot;WoM&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; [x,x,x])
[&quot;WoM&quot;,&quot;WoM&quot;,&quot;WoM&quot;]
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; [x,x,x]) &quot;WoM&quot;
[&quot;WoM&quot;,&quot;WoM&quot;,&quot;WoM&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>We said that for <code>IO</code>, using <code>return</code> makes an
I/O action that has no side-effects but just presents a value as its
result. So it makes sense that this law holds for <code>IO</code> as
well.</p>
<h3 id="right-identity">Right identity</h3>
<p>The second law states that if we have a monadic value and we use
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to feed it to <code>return</code>, the result is
our original monadic value. Formally:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="label law">m &gt;&gt;= return</code> is no different
than just <code class="label law">m</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This one might be a bit less obvious than the first one, but let’s
take a look at why it should hold. When we feed monadic values to
functions by using <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, those functions take normal
values and return monadic ones. <code>return</code> is also one such
function, if you consider its type. Like we said, <code>return</code>
puts a value in a minimal context that still presents that value as its
result. This means that, for instance, for <code>Maybe</code>, it
doesn’t introduce any failure and for lists, it doesn’t introduce any
extra non-determinism. Here’s a test run for a few monads:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; Just &quot;move on up&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
Just &quot;move on up&quot;
ghci&gt; [1,2,3,4] &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
[1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; putStrLn &quot;Wah!&quot; &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
Wah!</code></pre>
<p>If we take a closer look at the list example, the implementation for
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> is:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)</code></pre>
<p>So when we feed <code>[1,2,3,4]</code> to <code>return</code>, first
<code>return</code> gets mapped over <code>[1,2,3,4]</code>, resulting
in <code>[[1],[2],[3],[4]]</code> and then this gets concatenated and we
have our original list.</p>
<p>Left identity and right identity are basically laws that describe how
<code>return</code> should behave. It’s an important function for making
normal values into monadic ones and it wouldn’t be good if the monadic
value that it produced did a lot of other stuff.</p>
<h3 id="associativity">Associativity</h3>
<p>The final monad law says that when we have a chain of monadic
function applications with <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, it shouldn’t matter
how they’re nested. Formally written:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing <code class="label law">(m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g</code> is
just like doing <code
class="label law">m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Hmmm, now what’s going on here? We have one monadic value,
<code>m</code> and two monadic functions <code>f</code> and
<code>g</code>. When we’re doing
<code>(m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g</code>, we’re feeding <code>m</code>
to <code>f</code>, which results in a monadic value. Then, we feed that
monadic value to <code>g</code>. In the expression
<code>m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)</code>, we take a monadic
value and we feed it to a function that feeds the result of
<code>f x</code> to <code>g</code>. It’s not easy to see how those two
are equal, so let’s take a look at an example that makes this equality a
bit clearer.</p>
<p>Remember when we had our tightrope walker Pierre walk a rope while
birds landed on his balancing pole? To simulate birds landing on his
balancing pole, we made a chain of several functions that might produce
failure:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2 &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2 &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)</code></pre>
<p>We started with <code>Just (0,0)</code> and then bound that value to
the next monadic function, <code>landRight 2</code>. The result of that
was another monadic value which got bound into the next monadic
function, and so on. If we were to explicitly parenthesize this, we’d
write:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; ((return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)</code></pre>
<p>But we can also write the routine like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt;
landRight 2 x &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt;
landLeft 2 y &gt;&gt;= (\z -&gt;
landRight 2 z)))</code></pre>
<p><code>return (0,0)</code> is the same as <code>Just (0,0)</code> and
when we feed it to the lambda, the <code>x</code> becomes
<code>(0,0)</code>. <code>landRight</code> takes a number of birds and a
pole (a tuple of numbers) and that’s what it gets passed. This results
in a <code>Just (0,2)</code> and when we feed this to the next lambda,
<code>y</code> is <code>(0,2)</code>. This goes on until the final bird
landing produces a <code>Just (2,4)</code>, which is indeed the result
of the whole expression.</p>
<p>So it doesn’t matter how you nest feeding values to monadic
functions, what matters is their meaning. Here’s another way to look at
this law: consider composing two functions, <code>f</code> and
<code>g</code>. Composing two functions is implemented like so:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)
f . g = (\x -&gt; f (g x))</code></pre>
<p>If the type of <code>g</code> is <code>a -&gt; b</code> and the type
of <code>f</code> is <code>b -&gt; c</code>, we arrange them into a new
function which has a type of <code>a -&gt; c</code>, so that its
parameter is passed between those functions. Now what if those two
functions were monadic, that is, what if the values they returned were
monadic values? If we had a function of type <code>a -&gt; m b</code>,
we couldn’t just pass its result to a function of type
<code>b -&gt; m c</code>, because that function accepts a normal
<code>b</code>, not a monadic one. We could however, use
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code> to make that happen. So by using
<code>&gt;&gt;=</code>, we can compose two monadic functions:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>(&lt;=&lt;) :: (Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c)
f &lt;=&lt; g = (\x -&gt; g x &gt;&gt;= f)</code></pre>
<p>So now we can compose two monadic functions:</p>
<pre class="haskell:hs"><code>ghci&gt; let f x = [x,-x]
ghci&gt; let g x = [x*3,x*2]
ghci&gt; let h = f &lt;=&lt; g
ghci&gt; h 3
[9,-9,6,-6]</code></pre>
<p>Cool. So what does that have to do with the associativity law? Well,
when we look at the law as a law of compositions, it states that <code
class="label law">f &lt;=&lt; (g &lt;=&lt; h)</code> should be the same
as <code class="label law">(f &lt;=&lt; g) &lt;=&lt; h</code>. This is
just another way of saying that for monads, the nesting of operations
shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>If we translate the first two laws to use <code>&lt;=&lt;</code>,
then the left identity law states that for every monadic function
<code>f</code>, <code class="label law">f &lt;=&lt; return</code> is the
same as writing just <code class="label law">f</code> and the right
identity law says that <code class="label law">return &lt;=&lt; f</code>
is also no different from <code class="label law">f</code>.</p>
<p>This is very similar to how if <code>f</code> is a normal function,
<code>(f . g) . h</code> is the same as <code>f . (g . h)</code>,
<code>f . id</code> is always the same as <code>f</code> and
<code>id . f</code> is also just <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we took a look at the basics of monads and learned
how the <code>Maybe</code> monad and the list monad work. In the next
chapter, we’ll take a look at a whole bunch of other cool monads and
we’ll also learn how to make our own.</p>
