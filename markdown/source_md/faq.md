## Can I put this tutorial on my site or change it or whatever? 

Sure, it's licensed under a [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/){rel=license} license, so you can share and change this, as long as you do it with a smile on your face and for non-commercial purposes.

## Do you recommend any other Haskell reading material? 

There are many excellent Haskell tutorials available, but it’s also worth highlighting the official [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/documentation/){rel=nofollow} documentation. It provides a well-structured set of learning materials spanning beginner and intermediate topics.
This tutorial focuses on simple examples to ease newcomers into Haskell, while the broader documentation complements it by covering more practical and advanced use cases.

Another great Haskell resource is [Try Haskell](https://tryhaskell.org){rel=nofollow}, which allows you to try Haskell right in your browser and offers a rad interactive walkthrough.

## How do I get in touch with you? 

The best way would be to shoot me an email to bonus at learnyouahaskell dot com.
I kinda suck at email though, so please, please don't be mad if I don't reply in a timely fashion!

## Your book is cool but I want some exercises too! 

Coming soon!
A lot of people have been asking me to add exercises, so I'll be putting some up soonish.

## Tell me about yourself! 

My name is Miran Lipovača, I reside in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
Most of my time is spent on doing nothing in particular, but when I'm not doing nothing I'm either programming, drawing, boxing or playing bass.
I even have a cool [bass tabs](https://www.bigbasstabs.com) site.
I also have a collection of stuffed owls and sometimes I talk to them and they talk back.
