<p>Haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as return values. A function that does either of those is called a higher order function. Higher order functions aren't just a part of the Haskell experience, they pretty much are the Haskell experience. It turns out that if you want to define computations by defining what stuff <i>is</i> instead of defining steps that change some state and maybe looping them, higher order functions are indispensable. They're a really powerful way of solving problems and thinking about programs.</p>
<a name="curried-functions"></a><h2>Curried functions</h2>
<p>Every function in Haskell officially only takes one parameter. So how is it possible that we defined and used several functions that take more than one parameter so far? Well, it's a clever trick! All the functions that accepted <i>several parameters</i> so far have been <em>curried functions</em>. What does that mean? You'll understand it best on an example. Let's take our good friend, the <span class="fixed">max</span> function. It looks like it takes two parameters and returns the one that's bigger. Doing <span class="fixed">max 4 5</span> first creates a function that takes a parameter and returns either <span class="fixed">4</span> or that parameter, depending on which is bigger. Then, <span class="fixed">5</span> is applied to that function and that function produces our desired result. That sounds like a mouthful but it's actually a really cool concept. The following two calls are equivalent:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; max 4 5
5
ghci&gt; (max 4) 5
5
</pre>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/curry.png" alt="haskell curry" class="left" width="160" height="238">
<p>Putting a space between two things is simply <b>function application</b>. The space is sort of like an operator and it has the highest precedence. Let's examine the type of <span class="fixed">max</span>. It's <span class="fixed">max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</span>. That can also be written as <span class="fixed">max :: (Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a)</span>. That could be read as: <span class="fixed">max</span> takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and returns (that's the <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span>) a function that takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and returns an <span class="fixed">a</span>. That's why the return type and the parameters of functions are all simply separated with arrows.</p>
<p>So how is that beneficial to us? Simply speaking, if we call a function with too few parameters, we get back a <em>partially applied</em> function, meaning a function that takes as many parameters as we left out. Using partial application (calling functions with too few parameters, if you will) is a neat way to create functions on the fly so we can pass them to another function or to seed them with some data.</p>
<p>Take a look at this offensively simple function:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
multThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
multThree x y z = x * y * z
</pre>
<p>What really happens when we do <span class="fixed">multThree 3 5 9</span> or <span class="fixed">((multThree 3) 5) 9</span>? First, <span class="fixed">3</span> is applied to <span class="fixed">multThree</span>, because they're separated by a space. That creates a function that takes one parameter and returns a function. So then <span class="fixed">5</span> is applied to that, which creates a function that will take a parameter and multiply it by 15. <span class="fixed">9</span> is applied to that function and the result is 135 or something. Remember that this function's type could also be written as <span class="fixed">multThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; (a -&gt; a))</span>. The thing before the <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span> is the parameter that a function takes and the thing after it is what it returns. So our function takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and returns a function of type <span class="fixed">(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a)</span>. Similarly, this function takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and returns a function of type <span class="fixed">(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a</span>. And this function, finally, just takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and returns an <span class="fixed">a</span>. Take a look at this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; let multTwoWithNine = multThree 9
ghci&gt; multTwoWithNine 2 3
54
ghci&gt; let multWithEighteen = multTwoWithNine 2
ghci&gt; multWithEighteen 10
180
</pre>
<p>By calling functions with too few parameters, so to speak, we're creating new functions on the fly. What if we wanted to create a function that takes a number and compares it to <span class="fixed">100</span>? We could do something like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
compareWithHundred :: (Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
compareWithHundred x = compare 100 x
</pre>
<p>If we call it with <span class="fixed">99</span>, it returns a <span class="fixed">GT</span>. Simple stuff. Notice that the <span class="fixed">x</span> is on the right hand side on both sides of the equation. Now let's think about what <span class="fixed">compare 100</span> returns. It returns a function that takes a number and compares it with <span class="fixed">100</span>. Wow! Isn't that the function we wanted? We can rewrite this as:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
compareWithHundred :: (Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering
compareWithHundred = compare 100
</pre>
<p>The type declaration stays the same, because <span class="fixed">compare 100</span> returns a function. Compare has a type of <span class="fixed">(Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; Ordering)</span> and calling it with <span class="fixed">100</span> returns a <span class="fixed">(Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; Ordering</span>. The additional class constraint sneaks up there because <span class="fixed">100</span> is also part of the <span class="fixed">Num</span> typeclass.</p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Yo!</em> Make sure you really understand how curried functions and partial application work because they're really important!</div> <p>Infix functions can also be partially applied by using sections. To section an infix function, simply surround it with parentheses and only supply a parameter on one side. That creates a function that takes one parameter and then applies it to the side that's missing an operand. An insultingly trivial function:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
divideByTen :: (Floating a) =&gt; a -&gt; a
divideByTen = (/10)
</pre>
<p>Calling, say, <span class="fixed">divideByTen 200</span> is equivalent to doing <span class="fixed">200 / 10</span>, as is doing <span class="fixed">(/10) 200</span>. A function that checks if a character supplied to it is an uppercase letter:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
isUpperAlphanum :: Char -&gt; Bool
isUpperAlphanum = (`elem` ['A'..'Z'])
</pre>
<p>The only special thing about sections is using <span class="fixed">-</span>. From the definition of sections, <span class="fixed">(-4)</span> would result in a function that takes a number and subtracts 4 from it. However, for convenience, <span class="fixed">(-4)</span> means minus four. So if you want to make a function that subtracts 4 from the number it gets as a parameter, partially apply the <span class="fixed">subtract</span> function like so: <span class="fixed">(subtract 4)</span>.</p>
<p>What happens if we try to just do <span class="fixed">multThree 3 4</span> in GHCI instead of binding it to a name with a <i>let</i> or passing it to another function?</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; multThree 3 4
&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    No instance for (Show (t -&gt; t))
      arising from a use of `print' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-12
    Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Show (t -&gt; t))
    In the expression: print it
    In a 'do' expression: print it
</pre>
<p>GHCI is telling us that the expression produced a function of type <span class="fixed">a -&gt; a</span> but it doesn't know how to print it to the screen. Functions aren't instances of the <span class="fixed">Show</span> typeclass, so we can't get a neat string representation of a function. When we do, say, <span class="fixed">1 + 1</span> at the GHCI prompt, it first calculates that to <span class="fixed">2</span> and then calls <span class="fixed">show</span> on <span class="fixed">2</span> to get a textual representation of that number. And the textual representation of <span class="fixed">2</span> is just the string <span class="fixed">"2"</span>, which then gets printed to our screen.</p>
<a name="higher-orderism"></a><h2>Some higher-orderism is in order</h2>
<p>Functions can take functions as parameters and also return functions. To illustrate this, we're going to make a function that takes a function and then applies it twice to something!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
applyTwice :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
applyTwice f x = f (f x)
</pre>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/bonus.png" alt="rocktopus" class="right" width="166" height="190">
<p>First of all, notice the type declaration. Before, we didn't need parentheses because <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span> is naturally right-associative. However, here, they're mandatory. They indicate that the first parameter is a function that takes something and returns that same thing. The second parameter is something of that type also and the return value is also of the same type. We could read this type declaration in the curried way, but to save ourselves a headache, we'll just say that this function takes two parameters and returns one thing. The first parameter is a function (of type <span class="fixed">a -&gt; a</span>) and the second is that same <span class="fixed">a</span>. The function can also be <span class="fixed">Int -&gt; Int</span> or <span class="fixed">String -&gt; String</span> or whatever. But then, the second parameter to also has to be of that type. </p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Note:</em> From now on, we'll say that functions take several parameters despite each function actually taking only one parameter and returning partially applied functions until we reach a function that returns a solid value. So for simplicity's sake, we'll say that <span class="fixed">a -&gt; a -&gt; a</span> takes two parameters, even though we know what's really going on under the hood.</div>
<p>The body of the function is pretty simple. We just use the parameter <span class="fixed">f</span> as a function, applying <span class="fixed">x</span> to it by separating them with a space and then applying the result to <span class="fixed">f</span> again. Anyway, playing around with the function:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; applyTwice (+3) 10
16
ghci&gt; applyTwice (++ " HAHA") "HEY"
"HEY HAHA HAHA"
ghci&gt; applyTwice ("HAHA " ++) "HEY"
"HAHA HAHA HEY"
ghci&gt; applyTwice (multThree 2 2) 9
144
ghci&gt; applyTwice (3:) [1]
[3,3,1]
</pre>
<p>The awesomeness and usefulness of partial application is evident. If our function requires us to pass it a function that takes only one parameter, we can just partially apply a function to the point where it takes only one parameter and then pass it.</p>
<p>Now we're going to use higher order programming to implement a really useful function that's in the standard library. It's called <span class="fixed">zipWith</span>. It takes a function and two lists as parameters and then joins the two lists by applying the function between corresponding elements. Here's how we'll implement it:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
zipWith' :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b] -&gt; [c]
zipWith' _ [] _ = []
zipWith' _ _ [] = []
zipWith' f (x:xs) (y:ys) = f x y : zipWith' f xs ys
</pre>
<p>Look at the type declaration. The first parameter is a function that takes two things and produces a third thing. They don't have to be of the same type, but they can. The second and third parameter are lists. The result is also a list. The first has to be a list of <span class="fixed">a</span>'s, because the joining function takes <span class="fixed">a</span>'s as its first argument. The second has to be a list of <span class="fixed">b</span>'s, because the second parameter of the joining function is of type <span class="fixed">b</span>. The result is a list of <span class="fixed">c</span>'s. If the type declaration of a function says it accepts an <span class="fixed">a -&gt; b -&gt; c</span> function as a parameter, it will also accept an <span class="fixed">a -&gt; a -&gt; a</span> function, but not the other way around! Remember that when you're making functions, especially higher order ones, and you're unsure of the type, you can just try omitting the type declaration and then checking what Haskell infers it to be by using <span class="fixed">:t</span>.</p>
<p>The action in the function is pretty similar to the normal <span class="fixed">zip</span>. The edge conditions are the same, only there's an extra argument, the joining function, but that argument doesn't matter in the edge conditions, so we just use a <span class="fixed">_</span> for it. And function body at the last pattern is also similar to <span class="fixed">zip</span>, only it doesn't do <span class="fixed">(x,y)</span>, but <span class="fixed">f x y</span>. A single higher order function can be used for a multitude of different tasks if it's general enough. Here's a little demonstration of all the different things our <span class="fixed">zipWith'</span> function can do:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; zipWith' (+) [4,2,5,6] [2,6,2,3]
[6,8,7,9]
ghci&gt; zipWith' max [6,3,2,1] [7,3,1,5]
[7,3,2,5]
ghci&gt; zipWith' (++) ["foo ", "bar ", "baz "] ["fighters", "hoppers", "aldrin"]
["foo fighters","bar hoppers","baz aldrin"]
ghci&gt; zipWith' (*) (replicate 5 2) [1..]
[2,4,6,8,10]
ghci&gt; zipWith' (zipWith' (*)) [[1,2,3],[3,5,6],[2,3,4]] [[3,2,2],[3,4,5],[5,4,3]]
[[3,4,6],[9,20,30],[10,12,12]]
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, a single higher order function can be used in very versatile ways. Imperative programming usually uses stuff like for loops, while loops, setting something to a variable, checking its state, etc. to achieve some behavior and then wrap it around an interface, like a function. Functional programming uses higher order functions to abstract away common patterns, like examining two lists in pairs and doing something with those pairs or getting a set of solutions and eliminating the ones you don't need.
</p>
<p>We'll implement another function that's already in the standard library, called <span class="fixed">flip</span>. Flip simply takes a function and returns a function that is like our original function, only the first two arguments are flipped. We can implement it like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
flip' :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; c)
flip' f = g
    where g x y = f y x
</pre>
<p>Reading the type declaration, we say that it takes a function that takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and a <span class="fixed">b</span> and returns a function that takes a <span class="fixed">b</span> and an <span class="fixed">a</span>. But because functions are curried by default, the second pair of parentheses is really unnecessary, because <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span> is right associative by default. <span class="fixed">(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; a -&gt; c)</span> is the same as <span class="fixed">(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (b -&gt; (a -&gt; c))</span>, which is the same as <span class="fixed">(a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c</span>. We wrote that <span class="fixed">g x y = f y x</span>. If that's true, then <span class="fixed">f y x = g x y</span> must also hold, right? Keeping that in mind, we can define this function in an even simpler manner.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
flip' :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c
flip' f y x = f x y
</pre>
<p>Here, we take advantage of the fact that functions are curried. When we call <span class="fixed">flip' f</span> without the parameters <span class="fixed">y</span> and <span class="fixed">x</span>, it will return an <span class="fixed">f</span> that takes those two parameters but calls them flipped. Even though flipped functions are usually passed to other functions, we can take advantage of currying when making higher-order functions by thinking ahead and writing what their end result would be if they were called fully applied.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; flip' zip [1,2,3,4,5] "hello"
[('h',1),('e',2),('l',3),('l',4),('o',5)]
ghci&gt; zipWith (flip' div) [2,2..] [10,8,6,4,2]
[5,4,3,2,1]
</pre>
<a name="maps-and-filters"></a><h2>Maps and filters</h2>
<p><span class="function label">map</span> takes a function and a list and applies that function to every element in the list, producing a new list. Let's see what its type signature is and how it's defined.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
map :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map _ [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
</pre>
<p>The type signature says that it takes a function that takes an <span class="fixed">a</span> and returns a <span class="fixed">b</span>, a list of <span class="fixed">a</span>'s and returns a list of <span class="fixed">b</span>'s. It's interesting that just by looking at a function's type signature, you can sometimes tell what it does. <span class="fixed">map</span> is one of those really versatile higher-order functions that can be used in millions of different ways. Here it is in action:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; map (+3) [1,5,3,1,6]
[4,8,6,4,9]
ghci&gt; map (++ "!") ["BIFF", "BANG", "POW"]
["BIFF!","BANG!","POW!"]
ghci&gt; map (replicate 3) [3..6]
[[3,3,3],[4,4,4],[5,5,5],[6,6,6]]
ghci&gt; map (map (^2)) [[1,2],[3,4,5,6],[7,8]]
[[1,4],[9,16,25,36],[49,64]]
ghci&gt; map fst [(1,2),(3,5),(6,3),(2,6),(2,5)]
[1,3,6,2,2]
</pre>
<p>You've probably noticed that each of these could be achieved with a list comprehension. <span class="fixed">map (+3) [1,5,3,1,6]</span> is the same as writing <span class="fixed">[x+3 | x &lt;- [1,5,3,1,6]]</span>. However, using <span class="fixed">map</span> is much more readable for cases where you only apply some function to the elements of a list, especially once you're dealing with maps of maps and then the whole thing with a lot of brackets can get a bit messy.</p>
<p><span class="label function">filter</span> is a function that takes a predicate (a predicate is a function that tells whether something is true or not, so in our case, a function that returns a boolean value) and a list and then returns the list of elements that satisfy the predicate. The type signature and implementation go like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
filter _ [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x       = x : filter p xs
    | otherwise = filter p xs
</pre>
<p>Pretty simple stuff. If <span class="fixed">p x</span> evaluates to <span class="fixed">True</span>, the element gets included in the new list. If it doesn't, it stays out. Some usage examples:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; filter (&gt;3) [1,5,3,2,1,6,4,3,2,1]
[5,6,4]
ghci&gt; filter (==3) [1,2,3,4,5]
[3]
ghci&gt; filter even [1..10]
[2,4,6,8,10]
ghci&gt; let notNull x = not (null x) in filter notNull [[1,2,3],[],[3,4,5],[2,2],[],[],[]]
[[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[2,2]]
ghci&gt; filter (`elem` ['a'..'z']) "u LaUgH aT mE BeCaUsE I aM diFfeRent"
"uagameasadifeent"
ghci&gt; filter (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "i Laugh At you Because u R All The Same"
"LABRATS"
</pre>
<p>All of this could also be achived with list comprehensions by the use of predicates. There's no set rule for when to use <span class="fixed">map</span> and <span class="fixed">filter</span> versus using list comprehension, you just have to decide what's more readable depending on the code and the context. The <span class="fixed">filter</span> equivalent of applying several predicates in a list comprehension is either filtering something several times or joining the predicates with the logical <span class="fixed">&amp;&amp;</span> function. </p>
<p>Remember our quicksort function from the <a href="recursion.html">previous chapter</a>? We used list comprehensions to filter out the list elements that are smaller than (or equal to) and larger than the pivot. We can achieve the same functionality in a more readable way by using <span class="fixed">filter</span>:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
quicksort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) =
    let smallerSorted = quicksort (filter (&lt;=x) xs)
        biggerSorted = quicksort (filter (&gt;x) xs)
    in  smallerSorted ++ [x] ++ biggerSorted
</pre>

<p>Mapping and filtering is the bread and butter of every functional programmer's toolbox. Uh. It doesn't matter if you do it with the <span class="fixed">map</span> and <span class="fixed">filter</span> functions or list comprehensions. Recall how we solved the problem of finding right triangles with a certain circumference. With imperative programming, we would have solved it by nesting three loops and then testing if the current combination satisfies a right triangle and if it has the right perimeter. If that's the case, we would have printed it out to the screen or something. In functional programming, that pattern is achieved with mapping and filtering. You make a function that takes a value and produces some result. We map that function over a list of values and then we filter the resulting list out for the results that satisfy our search. Thanks to Haskell's laziness, even if you map something over a list several times and filter it several times, it will only pass over the list once.</p>
<p>Let's <em>find the largest number under 100,000 that's divisible by 3829</em>. To do that, we'll just filter a set of possibilities in which we know the solution lies. </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
largestDivisible :: (Integral a) =&gt; a
largestDivisible = head (filter p [100000,99999..])
    where p x = x `mod` 3829 == 0
</pre>
<p>We first make a list of all numbers lower than 100,000, descending. Then we filter it by our predicate and because the numbers are sorted in a descending manner, the largest number that satisfies our predicate is the first element of the filtered list. We didn't even need to use a finite list for our starting set. That's laziness in action again. Because we only end up using the head of the filtered list, it doesn't matter if the filtered list is finite or infinite. The evaluation stops when the first adequate solution is found.</p>
<p>Next up, we're going to <em>find the sum of all odd squares that are smaller than 10,000</em>. But first, because we'll be using it in our solution, we're going to introduce the <span class="label function">takeWhile</span> function. It takes a predicate and a list and then goes from the beginning of the list and returns its elements while the predicate holds true. Once an element is found for which the predicate doesn't hold, it stops. If we wanted to get the first word of the string <span class="fixed">"elephants know how to party"</span>, we could do <span class="fixed">takeWhile (/=' ') "elephants know how to party"</span> and it would return <span class="fixed">"elephants"</span>. Okay. The sum of all odd squares that are smaller than 10,000. First, we'll begin by mapping the <span class="fixed">(^2)</span> function to the infinite list <span class="fixed">[1..]</span>. Then we filter them so we only get the odd ones. And then, we'll take elements from that list while they are smaller than 10,000. Finally, we'll get the sum of that list. We don't even have to define a function for that, we can do it in one line in GHCI:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; sum (takeWhile (&lt;10000) (filter odd (map (^2) [1..])))
166650
</pre>
<p>Awesome! We start with some initial data (the infinite list of all natural numbers) and then we map over it, filter it and cut it until it suits our needs and then we just sum it up. We could have also written this using list comprehensions:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; sum (takeWhile (&lt;10000) [n^2 | n &lt;- [1..], odd (n^2)])
166650
</pre>
<p>It's a matter of taste as to which one you find prettier. Again, Haskell's property of laziness is what makes this possible. We can map over and filter an infinite list, because it won't actually map and filter it right away, it'll delay those actions. Only when we force Haskell to show us the sum does the <span class="fixed">sum</span> function say to the <span class="fixed">takeWhile</span> that it needs those numbers. <span class="fixed">takeWhile</span> forces the filtering and mapping to occur, but only until a number greater than or equal to 10,000 is encountered. </p>
<p>For our next problem, we'll be dealing with Collatz sequences. We take a natural number. If that number is even, we divide it by two. If it's odd, we multiply it by 3 and then add 1 to that. We take the resulting number and apply the same thing to it, which produces a new number and so on. In essence, we get a chain of numbers. It is thought that for all starting numbers, the chains finish at the number 1. So if we take the starting number 13, we get this sequence: <i>13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1</i>. 13*3 + 1 equals 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, etc. We see that the chain has 10 terms.</p>
<p>Now what we want to know is this: <em>for all starting numbers between 1 and 100, how many chains have a length greater than 15?</em> First off, we'll write a function that produces a chain:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
chain :: (Integral a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a]
chain 1 = [1]
chain n
    | even n =  n:chain (n `div` 2)
    | odd n  =  n:chain (n*3 + 1)
</pre>
<p>Because the chains end at 1, that's the edge case. This is a pretty standard recursive function.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; chain 10
[10,5,16,8,4,2,1]
ghci&gt; chain 1
[1]
ghci&gt; chain 30
[30,15,46,23,70,35,106,53,160,80,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1]
</pre>
<p>Yay! It seems to be working correctly. And now, the function that tells us the answer to our question:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
numLongChains :: Int
numLongChains = length (filter isLong (map chain [1..100]))
    where isLong xs = length xs &gt; 15
</pre>
<p>We map the <span class="fixed">chain</span> function to <span class="fixed">[1..100]</span> to get a list of chains, which are themselves represented as lists. Then, we filter them by a predicate that just checks whether a list's length is longer than 15. Once we've done the filtering, we see how many chains are left in the resulting list.</p>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Note:</em> This function has a type of <span class="fixed">numLongChains :: Int</span> because <span class="fixed">length</span> returns an <span class="fixed">Int</span> instead of a <span class="fixed">Num a</span> for historical reasons. If we wanted to return a more general <span class="fixed">Num a</span>, we could have used <span class="fixed">fromIntegral</span> on the resulting length.</div>
<p>Using <span class="fixed">map</span>, we can also do stuff like <span class="fixed">map (*) [0..]</span>, if not for any other reason than to illustrate how currying works and how (partially applied) functions are real values that you can pass around to other functions or put into lists (you just can't turn them to strings). So far, we've only mapped functions that take one parameter over lists, like <span class="fixed">map (*2) [0..]</span> to get a list of type <span class="fixed">(Num a) =&gt; [a]</span>, but we can also do <span class="fixed">map (*) [0..]</span> without a problem. What happens here is that the number in the list is applied to the function <span class="fixed">*</span>, which has a type of <span class="fixed">(Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</span>. Applying only one parameter to a function that takes two parameters returns a function that takes one parameter. If we map <span class="fixed">*</span> over the list <span class="fixed">[0..]</span>, we get back a list of functions that only take one parameter, so <span class="fixed">(Num a) =&gt; [a -&gt; a]</span>. <span class="fixed">map (*) [0..]</span> produces a list like the one we'd get by writing <span class="fixed">[(0*),(1*),(2*),(3*),(4*),(5*)..</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let listOfFuns = map (*) [0..]
ghci&gt; (listOfFuns !! 4) 5
20
</pre>
<p>Getting the element with the index <span class="fixed">4</span> from our list returns a function that's equivalent to <span class="fixed">(4*)</span>. And then, we just apply <span class="fixed">5</span> to that function. So that's like writing <span class="fixed">(4*) 5</span> or just <span class="fixed">4 * 5</span>.</p>
<a name="lambdas"></a><h2>Lambdas</h2>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/lambda.png" alt="lambda" class="right" width="203" height="230">
<p>Lambdas are basically anonymous functions that are used because we need some functions only once. Normally, we make a lambda with the sole purpose of passing it to a higher-order function. To make a lambda, we write a <span class="fixed">\</span> (because it kind of looks like the greek letter lambda if you squint hard enough) and then we write the parameters, separated by spaces. After that comes a <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span> and then the function body. We usually surround them by parentheses, because otherwise they extend all the way to the right.</p>
<p>If you look about 5 inches up, you'll see that we used a <i>where</i> binding in our <span class="fixed">numLongChains</span> function to make the <span class="fixed">isLong</span> function for the sole purpose of passing it to <span class="fixed">filter</span>. Well, instead of doing that, we can use a lambda:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
numLongChains :: Int
numLongChains = length (filter (\xs -&gt; length xs &gt; 15) (map chain [1..100]))
</pre>
<p>Lambdas are expressions, that's why we can just pass them like that. The expression <span class="fixed">(\xs -&gt; length xs &gt; 15)</span> returns a function that tells us whether the length of the list passed to it is greater than 15.</p>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/lamb.png" alt="lamb" class="left" width="200" height="134">
<p>People who are not well acquainted with how currying and partial application works often use lambdas where they don't need to. For instance, the expressions <span class="fixed">map (+3) [1,6,3,2]</span> and <span class="fixed">map (\x -&gt; x + 3) [1,6,3,2]</span> are equivalent since both <span class="fixed">(+3)</span> and <span class="fixed">(\x -&gt; x + 3)</span> are functions that take a number and add 3 to it. Needless to say, making a lambda in this case is stupid since using partial application is much more readable.</p>
<p>Like normal functions, lambdas can take any number of parameters:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; zipWith (\a b -&gt; (a * 30 + 3) / b) [5,4,3,2,1] [1,2,3,4,5]
[153.0,61.5,31.0,15.75,6.6]
</pre>
<p>And like normal functions, you can pattern match in lambdas. The only difference is that you can't define several patterns for one parameter, like making a <span class="fixed">[]</span> and a <span class="fixed">(x:xs)</span> pattern for the same parameter and then having values fall through. If a pattern matching fails in a lambda, a runtime error occurs, so be careful when pattern matching in lambdas!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; map (\(a,b) -&gt; a + b) [(1,2),(3,5),(6,3),(2,6),(2,5)]
[3,8,9,8,7]
</pre>
<p>Lambdas are normally surrounded by parentheses unless we mean for them to extend all the way to the right. Here's something interesting: due to the way functions are curried by default, these two are equivalent:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
addThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
addThree x y z = x + y + z
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
addThree :: (Num a) =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
addThree = \x -&gt; \y -&gt; \z -&gt; x + y + z
</pre>
<p>If we define a function like this, it's obvious why the type declaration is what it is. There are three <span class="fixed">-&gt;</span>'s in both the type declaration and the equation. But of course, the first way to write functions is far more readable, the second one is pretty much a gimmick to illustrate currying.</p>
<p>However, there are times when using this notation is cool. I think that the <span class="fixed">flip</span> function is the most readable when defined like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
flip' :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; b -&gt; a -&gt; c
flip' f = \x y -&gt; f y x
</pre>
<p>Even though that's the same as writing <span class="fixed">flip' f x y = f y x</span>, we make it obvious that this will be used for producing a new function most of the time. The most common use case with <span class="fixed">flip</span> is calling it with just the function parameter and then passing the resulting function on to a map or a filter. So use lambdas in this way when you want to make it explicit that your function is mainly meant to be partially applied and passed on to a function as a parameter.</p>
<a name="folds"></a><h2>Only folds and horses</h2>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/origami.png" alt="folded bird" class="right" width="220" height="221">
<p>Back when we were dealing with recursion, we noticed a theme throughout many of the recursive functions that operated on lists. Usually, we'd have an edge case for the empty list. We'd introduce the <span class="fixed">x:xs</span> pattern and then we'd do some action that involves a single element and the rest of the list. It turns out this is a very common pattern, so a couple of very useful functions were introduced to encapsulate it. These functions are called folds. They're sort of like the <span class="fixed">map</span> function, only they reduce the list to some single value. </p>
<p>A fold takes a binary function, a starting value (I like to call it the accumulator) and a list to fold up. The binary function itself takes two parameters. The binary function is called with the accumulator and the first (or last) element and produces a new accumulator. Then, the binary function is called again with the new accumulator and the now new first (or last) element, and so on. Once we've walked over the whole list, only the accumulator remains, which is what we've reduced the list to.</p>
<p>First let's take a look at the <span class="label function">foldl</span> function, also called the left fold. It folds the list up from the left side. The binary function is applied between the starting value and the head of the list. That produces a new accumulator value and the binary function is called with that value and the next element, etc.</p>
<p>Let's implement <span class="fixed">sum</span> again, only this time, we'll use a fold instead of explicit recursion.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
sum' :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum' xs = foldl (\acc x -&gt; acc + x) 0 xs
</pre>
<p>Testing, one two three:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; sum' [3,5,2,1]
11
</pre>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/foldl.png" alt="foldl" class="left" width="172" height="348">
<p>Let's take an in-depth look into how this fold happens. <span class="fixed">\acc x -&gt; acc + x</span> is the binary function. <span class="fixed">0</span> is the starting value and <span class="fixed">xs</span> is the list to be folded up. Now first, <span class="fixed">0</span> is used as the <span class="fixed">acc</span> parameter to the binary function and <span class="fixed">3</span> is used as the <span class="fixed">x</span> (or the current element) parameter. <span class="fixed">0 + 3</span> produces a <span class="fixed">3</span> and it becomes the new accumulator value, so to speak. Next up, <span class="fixed">3</span> is used as the accumulator value and <span class="fixed">5</span> as the current element and <span class="fixed">8</span> becomes the new accumulator value. Moving forward, <span class="fixed">8</span> is the accumulator value, <span class="fixed">2</span> is the current element, the new accumulator value is <span class="fixed">10</span>. Finally, that <span class="fixed">10</span> is used as the accumulator value and <span class="fixed">1</span> as the current element, producing an <span class="fixed">11</span>. Congratulations, you've done a fold! </p>
<p>This professional diagram on the left illustrates how a fold happens, step by step (day by day!). The greenish brown number is the accumulator value. You can see how the list is sort of consumed up from the left side by the accumulator. Om nom nom nom! If we take into account that functions are curried, we can write this implementation ever more succinctly, like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
sum' :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum' = foldl (+) 0
</pre>
<p>The lambda function <span class="fixed">(\acc x -&gt; acc + x)</span> is the same as <span class="fixed">(+)</span>. We can omit the <span class="fixed">xs</span> as the parameter because calling <span class="fixed">foldl (+) 0</span> will return a function that takes a list. Generally, if you have a function like <span class="fixed">foo a = bar b a</span>, you can rewrite it as <span class="fixed">foo = bar b</span>, because of currying.</p>
<p>Anyhoo, let's implement another function with a left fold before moving on to right folds. I'm sure you all know that <span class="fixed">elem</span> checks whether a value is part of a list so I won't go into that again (whoops, just did!). Let's implement it with a left fold. </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
elem' :: (Eq a) =&gt; a -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
elem' y ys = foldl (\acc x -&gt; if x == y then True else acc) False ys
</pre>
<p>Well, well, well, what do we have here? The starting value and accumulator here is a boolean value. The type of the accumulator value and the end result is always the same when dealing with folds. Remember that if you ever don't know what to use as a starting value, it'll give you some idea. We start off with <span class="fixed">False</span>. It makes sense to use <span class="fixed">False</span> as a starting value. We assume it isn't there. Also, if we call a fold on an empty list, the result will just be the starting value. Then we check the current element is the element we're looking for. If it is, we set the accumulator to <span class="fixed">True</span>. If it's not, we just leave the accumulator unchanged. If it was <span class="fixed">False</span> before, it stays that way because this current element is not it. If it was <span class="fixed">True</span>, we leave it at that.</p>
<p>The right fold, <span class="function label">foldr</span> works in a similar way to the left fold, only the accumulator eats up the values from the right. Also, the left fold's binary function has the accumulator as the first parameter and the current value as the second one (so <span class="fixed">\acc x -&gt; ...</span>), the right fold's binary function has the current value as the first parameter and the accumulator as the second one (so <span class="fixed">\x acc -&gt; ...</span>). It kind of makes sense that the right fold has the accumulator on the right, because it folds from the right side.</p>
<p>The accumulator value (and hence, the result) of a fold can be of any type. It can be a number, a boolean or even a new list. We'll be implementing the map function with a right fold. The accumulator will be a list, we'll be accumulating the mapped list element by element. From that, it's obvious that the starting element will be an empty list.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
map' :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [b]
map' f xs = foldr (\x acc -&gt; f x : acc) [] xs
</pre>
<p>If we're mapping <span class="fixed">(+3)</span> to <span class="fixed">[1,2,3]</span>, we approach the list from the right side. We take the last element, which is <span class="fixed">3</span> and apply the function to it, which ends up being <span class="fixed">6</span>. Then, we prepend it to the accumulator, which is was <span class="fixed">[]</span>. <span class="fixed">6:[]</span> is <span class="fixed">[6]</span> and that's now the accumulator. We apply <span class="fixed">(+3)</span> to <span class="fixed">2</span>, that's <span class="fixed">5</span> and we prepend (<span class="fixed">:</span>) it to the accumulator, so the accumulator is now <span class="fixed">[5,6]</span>. We apply <span class="fixed">(+3)</span> to <span class="fixed">1</span> and prepend that to the accumulator and so the end value is <span class="fixed">[4,5,6]</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could have implemented this function with a left fold too. It would be <span class="fixed">map' f xs = foldl (\acc x -&gt; acc ++ [f x]) [] xs</span>, but the thing is that the <span class="fixed">++</span> function is much more expensive than <span class="fixed">:</span>, so we usually use right folds when we're building up new lists from a list.</p>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/washmachine.png" alt="fold this up!" class="right" width="250" height="205">
<p>If you reverse a list, you can do a right fold on it just like you would have done a left fold and vice versa. Sometimes you don't even have to do that. The <span class="fixed">sum</span> function can be implemented pretty much the same with a left and right fold. One big difference is that right folds work on infinite lists, whereas left ones don't! To put it plainly, if you take an infinite list at some point and you fold it up from the right, you'll eventually reach the beginning of the list. However, if you take an infinite list at a point and you try to fold it up from the left, you'll never reach an end! </p>
<p><em>Folds can be used to implement any function where you traverse a list once, element by element, and then return something based on that. Whenever you want to traverse a list to return something, chances are you want a fold.</em> That's why folds are, along with maps and filters, one of the most useful types of functions in functional programming.</p>
<p>The <span class="label function">foldl1</span> and <span class="label function">foldr1</span> functions work much like <span class="fixed">foldl</span> and <span class="fixed">foldr</span>, only you don't need to provide them with an explicit starting value. They assume the first (or last) element of the list to be the starting value and then start the fold with the element next to it. With that in mind, the <span class="fixed">sum</span> function can be implemented like so: <span class="fixed">sum = foldl1 (+)</span>. Because they depend on the lists they fold up having at least one element, they cause runtime errors if called with empty lists. <span class="fixed">foldl</span> and <span class="fixed">foldr</span>, on the other hand, work fine with empty lists. When making a fold, think about how it acts on an empty list. If the function doesn't make sense when given an empty list, you can probably use a <span class="fixed">foldl1</span> or <span class="fixed">foldr1</span> to implement it.</p>
<p>Just to show you how powerful folds are, we're going to implement a bunch of standard library functions by using folds:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
maximum' :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
maximum' = foldr1 (\x acc -&gt; if x &gt; acc then x else acc)

reverse' :: [a] -&gt; [a]
reverse' = foldl (\acc x -&gt; x : acc) []

product' :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
product' = foldr1 (*)

filter' :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
filter' p = foldr (\x acc -&gt; if p x then x : acc else acc) []

head' :: [a] -&gt; a
head' = foldr1 (\x _ -&gt; x)

last' :: [a] -&gt; a
last' = foldl1 (\_ x -&gt; x)
</pre>
<p><span class="fixed">head</span> is better implemented by pattern matching, but this just goes to show, you can still achieve it by using folds. Our <span class="fixed">reverse'</span> definition is pretty clever, I think. We take a starting value of an empty list and then approach our list from the left and just prepend to our accumulator. In the end, we build up a reversed list. <span class="fixed">\acc x -&gt; x : acc</span> kind of looks like the <span class="fixed">:</span> function, only the parameters are flipped. That's why we could have also written our reverse as <span class="fixed">foldl (flip (:)) []</span>. </p>
<p>Another way to picture right and left folds is like this: say we have a right fold and the binary function is <span class="fixed">f</span> and the starting value is <span class="fixed">z</span>. If we're right folding over the list <span class="fixed">[3,4,5,6]</span>, we're essentially doing this: <span class="fixed">f 3 (f 4 (f 5 (f 6 z)))</span>. <span class="fixed">f</span> is called with the last element in the list and the accumulator, that value is given as the accumulator to the next to last value and so on. If we take <span class="fixed">f</span> to be <span class="fixed">+</span> and the starting accumulator value to be <span class="fixed">0</span>, that's <span class="fixed">3 + (4 + (5 + (6 + 0)))</span>. Or if we write <span class="fixed">+</span> as a prefix function, that's <span class="fixed">(+) 3 ((+) 4 ((+) 5 ((+) 6 0)))</span>. Similarly, doing a left fold over that list with <span class="fixed">g</span> as the binary function and <span class="fixed">z</span> as the accumulator is the equivalent of <span class="fixed">g (g (g (g z 3) 4) 5) 6</span>. If we use <span class="fixed">flip (:)</span> as the binary function and <span class="fixed">[]</span> as the accumulator (so we're reversing the list), then that's the equivalent of <span class="fixed">flip (:) (flip (:) (flip (:) (flip (:) [] 3) 4) 5) 6</span>. And sure enough, if you evaluate that expression, you get <span class="fixed">[6,5,4,3]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="function label">scanl</span> and <span class="function label">scanr</span> are like <span class="fixed">foldl</span> and <span class="fixed">foldr</span>, only they report all the intermediate accumulator states in the form of a list. There are also <span class="fixed">scanl1</span> and <span class="fixed">scanr1</span>, which are analogous to <span class="fixed">foldl1</span> and <span class="fixed">foldr1</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

<p>When using a <span class="fixed">scanl</span>, the final result will be in the last element of the resulting list while a <span class="fixed">scanr</span> will place the result in the head.</p>
<p>Scans are used to monitor the progression of a function that can be implemented as a fold. Let's answer us this question: <em>How many elements does it take for the sum of the roots of all natural numbers to exceed 1000?</em> To get the squares of all natural numbers, we just do <span class="fixed">map sqrt [1..]</span>. Now, to get the sum, we could do a fold, but because we're interested in how the sum progresses, we're going to do a scan. Once we've done the scan, we just see how many sums are under 1000. The first sum in the scanlist will be 1, normally. The second will be 1 plus the square root of 2. The third will be that plus the square root of 3. If there are X sums under 1000, then it takes X+1 elements for the sum to exceed 1000.</p>

<p>We use <span class="fixed">takeWhile</span> here instead of <span class="fixed">filter</span> because <span class="fixed">filter</span> doesn't work on infinite lists.

<p>What the heck? What is this useless operator? It's just function application! Well, almost, but not quite! Whereas normal function application (putting a space between two things) has a really high precedence, the <span class="fixed">$</span> function has the lowest precedence. Function application with a space is left-associative (so <span class="fixed">f a b c</span> is the same as <span class="fixed">((f a) b) c)</span>), function application with <span class="fixed">$</span> is right-associative.</p>
<p>That's all very well, but how does this help us? Most of the time, it's a convenience function so that we don't have to write so many parentheses. Consider the expression <span class="fixed">sum (map sqrt [1..130])</span>. Because <span class="fixed">$</span> has such a low precedence, we can rewrite that expression as <span class="fixed">sum $ map sqrt [1..130]</span>, saving ourselves precious keystrokes! When a <span class="fixed">$</span> is encountered, the expression on its right is applied as the parameter to the function on its left. How about <span class="fixed">sqrt 3 + 4 + 9</span>? This adds together 9, 4 and the square root of 3. If we want get the square root of <i>3 + 4 + 9</i>, we'd have to write <span class="fixed">sqrt (3 + 4 + 9)</span> or if we use <span class="fixed">$</span> we can write it as <span class="fixed">sqrt $ 3 + 4 + 9</span> because <span class="fixed">$</span> has the lowest precedence of any operator. That's why you can imagine a <span class="fixed">$</span> being sort of the equivalent of writing an opening parentheses and then writing a closing one on the far right side of the expression.</p>
<p>How about <span class="fixed">sum (filter (&gt; 10) (map (*2) [2..10]))</span>? Well, because <span class="fixed">$</span> is right-associative, <span class="fixed">f (g (z x))</span> is equal to <span class="fixed">f $ g $ z x</span>. And so, we can rewrite <span class="fixed">sum (filter (&gt; 10) (map (*2) [2..10]))</span> as <span class="fixed">sum $ filter (&gt; 10) $ map (*2) [2..10]</span>. </p>
<p>But apart from getting rid of parentheses, <span class="fixed">$</span> means that function application can be treated just like another function. That way, we can, for instance, map function application over a list of functions.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

<a name="composition"></a><h2>Function composition</h2>
<p>In mathematics, function composition is defined like this: <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/composition.png" alt=" (f . g)(x) = f(g(x))">, meaning that composing two functions produces a new function that, when called with a parameter, say, <i>x</i> is the equivalent of calling <i>g</i> with the parameter <i>x</i> and then calling the <i>f</i> with that result.</p>
<p>In Haskell, function composition is pretty much the same thing. We do function composition with the <span class="fixed">.</span> function, which is defined like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; c
f . g = \x -&gt; f (g x)
</pre>
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/notes.png" alt="notes" class="left" width="230" height="198">
<p>Mind the type declaration. <span class="fixed">f</span> must take as its parameter a value that has the same type as <span class="fixed">g</span>'s return value. So the resulting function takes a parameter of the same type that <span class="fixed">g</span> takes and returns a value of the same type that <span class="fixed">f</span> returns. The expression <span class="fixed">negate . (* 3)</span> returns a function that takes a number, multiplies it by 3 and then negates it.</p>
<p>One of the uses for function composition is making functions on the fly to pass to other functions. Sure, can use lambdas for that, but many times, function composition is clearer and more concise. Say we have a list of numbers and we want to turn them all into negative numbers. One way to do that would be to get each number's absolute value and then negate it, like so:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; map (\x -&gt; negate (abs x)) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]
[-5,-3,-6,-7,-3,-2,-19,-24]
</pre>
<p>Notice the lambda and how it looks like the result function composition. Using function composition, we can rewrite that as:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; map (negate . abs) [5,-3,-6,7,-3,2,-19,24]
[-5,-3,-6,-7,-3,-2,-19,-24]
</pre>
<p>Fabulous! Function composition is right-associative, so we can compose many functions at a time. The expression <span class="fixed">f (g (z x))</span> is equivalent to <span class="fixed">(f . g . z) x</span>. With that in mind, we can turn</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; map (\xs -&gt; negate (sum (tail xs))) [[1..5],[3..6],[1..7]]
[-14,-15,-27]
</pre>
<p>into</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; map (negate . sum . tail) [[1..5],[3..6],[1..7]]
[-14,-15,-27]
</pre>
<p>But what about functions that take several parameters? Well, if we want to use them in function composition, we usually have to partially apply them just so much that each function takes just one parameter. <span class="fixed"> sum (replicate 5 (max 6.7 8.9))</span> can be rewritten as <span class="fixed">(sum . replicate 5 . max 6.7) 8.9</span> or as <span class="fixed">sum . replicate 5 . max 6.7 $ 8.9</span>. What goes on in here is this: a function that takes what <span class="fixed">max 6.7</span> takes and applies <span class="fixed">replicate 5</span> to it is created. Then, a function that takes the result of that and does a sum of it is created. Finally, that function is called with <span class="fixed">8.9</span>. But normally, you just read that as: apply <span class="fixed">8.9</span> to <span class="fixed">max 6.7</span>, then apply <span class="fixed">replicate 5</span> to that and then apply <span class="fixed">sum</span> to that. If you want to rewrite an expression with a lot of parentheses by using function composition, you can start by putting the last parameter of the innermost function after a <span class="fixed">$</span> and then just composing all the other function calls, writing them without their last parameter and putting dots between them. If you have <span class="fixed">replicate 100 (product (map (*3) (zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] [4,5,6,7,8])))</span>, you can write it as <span class="fixed">replicate 100 . product . map (*3) . zipWith max [1,2,3,4,5] $ [4,5,6,7,8]</span>. If the expression ends with three parentheses, chances are that if you translate it into function composition, it'll have three composition operators.</p>
<p>Another common use of function composition is defining functions in the so-called point free style (also called the point<i>less</i> style). Take for example this function that we wrote earlier:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
sum' :: (Num a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; a
sum' xs = foldl (+) 0 xs
</pre>
<p>The <span class="fixed">xs</span> is exposed on both right sides. Because of currying, we can omit the <span class="fixed">xs</span> on both sides, because calling <span class="fixed">foldl (+) 0</span> creates a function that takes a list. Writing the function as <span class="fixed">sum' = foldl (+) 0</span> is called writing it in point free style. How would we write this in point free style?</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fn x = ceiling (negate (tan (cos (max 50 x))))
</pre>
<p>We can't just get rid of the <span class="fixed">x</span> on both right right sides. The <span class="fixed">x</span> in the function body has parentheses after it. <span class="fixed">cos (max 50)</span> wouldn't make sense. You can't get the cosine of a function. What we can do is express <span class="fixed">fn</span> as a composition of functions.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fn = ceiling . negate . tan . cos . max 50
</pre>
<p>Excellent! Many times, a point free style is more readable and concise, because it makes you think about functions and what kind of functions composing them results in instead of thinking about data and how it's shuffled around. You can take simple functions and use composition as glue to form more complex functions. However, many times, writing a function in point free style can be less readable if a function is too complex. That's why making long chains of function composition is discouraged, although I plead guilty of sometimes being too composition-happy. The prefered style is to use <i>let</i> bindings to give labels to intermediary results or split the problem into sub-problems and then put it together so that the function makes sense to someone reading it instead of just making a huge composition chain.</p>
<p>In the section about maps and filters, we solved a problem of finding the sum of all odd squares that are smaller than 10,000. Here's what the solution looks like when put into a function.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
oddSquareSum :: Integer
oddSquareSum = sum (takeWhile (&lt;10000) (filter odd (map (^2) [1..])))
</pre>
<p>Being such a fan of function composition, I would have probably written that like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
oddSquareSum :: Integer
oddSquareSum = sum . takeWhile (&lt;10000) . filter odd . map (^2) $ [1..]
</pre>
<p>However, if there was a chance of someone else reading that code, I would have written it like this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
oddSquareSum :: Integer
oddSquareSum =
    let oddSquares = filter odd $ map (^2) [1..]
        belowLimit = takeWhile (&lt;10000) oddSquares
    in  sum belowLimit
</pre>
<p>It wouldn't win any code golf competition, but someone reading the function will probably find it easier to read than a composition chain.</p>
