        <h1>For a Few Monads More</h1>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/clint.png" alt="there are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. those who learn them a haskell and those who have the job of coding java" class="right" width="189" height="400">

<p>
We've seen how monads can be used to take values with contexts and apply them to
functions and how using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> or <span
class="fixed">do</span> notation allows us to focus on the values themselves while the
context gets handled for us.
</p>

<p>
We've met the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad and seen how it adds a
context of possible failure to values. We've learned about the list monad and
saw how it lets us easily introduce non-determinism into our programs. We've also
learned how to work in the <span class="fixed">IO</span> monad, even before we
knew what a monad was!

<p>
In this chapter, we're going to learn about a few other monads. We'll see how
they can make our programs clearer by letting us treat all sorts of values as
monadic ones. Exploring a few monads more will also solidify our intuition for
monads.
</p>

<p>
The monads that we'll be exploring are all part of the <span class="fixed">mtl</span>
package. A Haskell package is a collection of modules. The <span
class="fixed">mtl</span> package comes with the Haskell Platform, so you
probably already have it. To check if you do, type <span
class="fixed">ghc-pkg list</span> in the command-line. This will show which
Haskell packages you have installed and one of them should be <span
class="fixed">mtl</span>, followed by a version number.
</p>

<a name="writer"></a>
<h2>Writer? I hardly know her!</h2>

<p>
We've loaded our gun with the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad, the list
monad and the <span class="fixed">IO</span> monad. Now let's put the <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> monad in the chamber and see what happens when we
fire it!
</p>

<p>
Whereas <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> is for values with an added context of
failure and the list is for non-deterministic values, the <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> monad is for values that have another value attached
that acts as a sort of log value. <span class="fixed">Writer</span> allows us to
do computations while making sure that all the log values are combined into one
log value that then gets attached to the result.
</p>

<p>
For instance, we might want to equip our values with strings that explain what's
going on, probably for debugging purposes. Consider a function that takes a
number of bandits in a gang and tells us if that's a big gang or not. That's a
very simple function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
isBigGang :: Int -&gt; Bool
isBigGang x = x &gt; 9
</pre>

<p>
Now, what if instead of just giving us a <span class="fixed">True</span> or
<span class="fixed">False</span> value, we want it to also return a log string
that says what it did? Well, we just make that string and return it alongside
our <span class="fixed">Bool</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
isBigGang :: Int -&gt; (Bool, String)
isBigGang x = (x &gt; 9, "Compared gang size to 9.")
</pre>

<p>
So now instead of just returning a <span class="fixed">Bool</span>, we return a
tuple where the first component of the tuple is the actual value and the second
component is the string that accompanies that value. There's some added context
to our value now. Let's give this a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; isBigGang 3
(False,"Compared gang size to 9.")
ghci&gt; isBigGang 30
(True,"Compared gang size to 9.")
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/tuco.png" alt="when you have to poop, poop, don't talk" class="left"
width="196" height="280">

<p>
So far so good. <span class="fixed">isBigGang</span> takes a normal value and
returns a value with a context. As we've just seen, feeding it a normal value is
not a problem. Now what if we already have a value that has a log string
attached to it, such as <span class="fixed">(3, "Smallish gang.")</span>,
and we want to feed it to <span class="fixed">isBigGang</span>? It seems like
once again, we're faced with this question: if we have a function that takes a
normal value and returns a value with a context, how do we take a value with a
context and feed it to the function?
</p>

<p>
When we were exploring the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad, we made a
function <span class="fixed">applyMaybe</span>, which took a <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> value and a function of type <span class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe b</span>
and fed that <span class="fixed">Maybe a</span> value into the function, even
though the function takes a normal <span class="fixed">a</span> instead of a <span class="fixed">Maybe
a</span>. It did this by minding the context that comes with <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> values, which is that they are values with possible
failure. But inside the <span class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe b</span> function, we
were able to treat that value as just a normal value, because <span
class="fixed">applyMaybe</span> (which later became <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>)
took care of checking if it was a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> or a <span
class="fixed">Just</span> value.
</p>

<p>
In the same vein, let's make a function that takes a value with an attached log,
that is, an <span class="fixed">(a,String)</span> value and a function of type
<span class="fixed">a -&gt; (b,String)</span> and feeds that value into the
function. We'll call it <span class="fixed">applyLog</span>. But because an
<span class="fixed">(a,String)</span> value doesn't carry with it a context of
possible failure, but rather a context of an additional log value, <span
class="fixed">applyLog</span> is going to make sure that the log of the original
value isn't lost, but is joined together with the log of the value that results
from the function. Here's the implementation of <span class="fixed">applyLog</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
applyLog :: (a,String) -&gt; (a -&gt; (b,String)) -&gt; (b,String)
applyLog (x,log) f = let (y,newLog) = f x in (y,log ++ newLog)
</pre>

<p>
When we have a value with a context and we want to feed it to a function, we
usually try to separate the actual value from the context and then try to apply
the function to the value and then see that the context is taken care of. In the
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad, we checked if the value was a <span
class="fixed">Just x</span> and if it was, we took that <span
class="fixed">x</span> and applied the function to it. In this case,
it's very easy to find the actual value, because we're dealing with a pair where
one component is the value and the other a log. So first we just take the value,
which is <span class="fixed">x</span> and we apply the function <span
class="fixed">f</span> to it. We get a pair of <span class="fixed">(y,newLog)</span>, where
<span class="fixed">y</span> is the new result and <span class="fixed">newLog</span>
the new log. But if we returned that as the result, the old log value wouldn't
be included in the result, so we return a pair of <span class="fixed">(y,log ++
newLog)</span>. We use <span class="fixed">++</span> to append the new log to
the old one.
</p>

<p>
Here's <span class="fixed">applyLog</span> in action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (3, "Smallish gang.") `applyLog` isBigGang
(False,"Smallish gang.Compared gang size to 9")
ghci&gt; (30, "A freaking platoon.") `applyLog` isBigGang
(True,"A freaking platoon.Compared gang size to 9")
</pre>

<p>
The results are similar to before, only now the number of people in the gang had
its accompanying log and it got included in the result log. Here are a few more
examples of using <span class="fixed">applyLog</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; ("Tobin","Got outlaw name.") `applyLog` (\x -&gt; (length x, "Applied length."))
(5,"Got outlaw name.Applied length.")
ghci&gt; ("Bathcat","Got outlaw name.") `applyLog` (\x -&gt; (length x, "Applied length"))
(7,"Got outlaw name.Applied length")
</pre>

<p>
See how inside the lambda, <span class="fixed">x</span> is just a normal string
and not a tuple and how <span class="fixed">applyLog</span> takes care of
appending the logs.
</p>

<h3>Monoids to the rescue</h3>

<div class="hintbox">
Be sure you know what <a href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html#monoids">monoids</a> are at this point! Cheers.
</div>

<p>
Right now, <span class="fixed">applyLog</span> takes values of type <span
class="fixed">(a,String)</span>, but is there a reason that the log has to be a
<span class="fixed">String</span>? It uses <span class="fixed">++</span> to append
the logs, so wouldn't this work on any kind of list, not just a list of
characters? Sure it would. We can go ahead and change its type to this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
applyLog :: (a,[c]) -&gt; (a -&gt; (b,[c])) -&gt; (b,[c])
</pre>

<p>
Now, the log is a list. The type of values contained in the list has to be the
same for the original list as well as for the list that the function returns,
otherwise we wouldn't be able to use <span class="fixed">++</span> to stick them
together.
</p>

<p>
Would this work for bytestrings? There's no reason it shouldn't. However, the
type we have now only works for lists. It seems like we'd have to make a
separate <span class="fixed">applyLog</span> for bytestrings. But wait! Both
lists and bytestrings are monoids. As such, they are both instances of the
<span class="fixed">Monoid</span> type class, which means that they implement
the <span class="fixed">mappend</span> function. And for both lists and
bytestrings, <span class="fixed">mappend</span> is for appending. Watch:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [1,2,3] `mappend` [4,5,6]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
ghci&gt; B.pack [99,104,105] `mappend` B.pack [104,117,97,104,117,97]
Chunk "chi" (Chunk "huahua" Empty)
</pre>

<p>
Cool! Now our <span class="fixed">applyLog</span> can work for any monoid. We
have to change the type to reflect this, as well as the implementation, because
we have to change <span class="fixed">++</span> to <span class="fixed">mappend</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
applyLog :: (Monoid m) =&gt; (a,m) -&gt; (a -&gt; (b,m)) -&gt; (b,m)
applyLog (x,log) f = let (y,newLog) = f x in (y,log `mappend` newLog)
</pre>

<p>
Because the accompanying value can now be any monoid value, we no longer have to
think of the tuple as a value and a log, but now we can think of it as a value
with an accompanying monoid value. For instance, we can have a tuple that has an
item name and an item price as the monoid value. We just use the <span
class="fixed">Sum</span> newtype to make sure that the prices get added as we
operate with the items. Here's a function that adds drink to some cowboy food:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.Monoid

type Food = String
type Price = Sum Int

addDrink :: Food -&gt; (Food,Price)
addDrink "beans" = ("milk", Sum 25)
addDrink "jerky" = ("whiskey", Sum 99)
addDrink _ = ("beer", Sum 30)
</pre>

<p>
We use strings to represent foods and an <span class="fixed">Int</span>
in a <span class="fixed">Sum</span> <span class="fixed">newtype</span> wrapper to keep
track of how many cents something costs. Just a reminder, doing <span
class="fixed">mappend</span> with <span class="fixed">Sum</span> results in the
wrapped values getting added together:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Sum 3 `mappend` Sum 9
Sum {getSum = 12}
</pre>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">addDrink</span> function is pretty simple. If we're
eating beans, it returns <span class="fixed">"milk"</span> along with <span
class="fixed">Sum 25</span>, so 25 cents wrapped in <span
class="fixed">Sum</span>. If we're eating jerky we drink whiskey and if we're
eating anything else we drink beer. Just normally applying this function to a
food wouldn't be terribly interesting right now, but using <span
class="fixed">applyLog</span> to feed a food that comes with a price itself into
this function is interesting:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; ("beans", Sum 10) `applyLog` addDrink
("milk",Sum {getSum = 35})
ghci&gt; ("jerky", Sum 25) `applyLog` addDrink
("whiskey",Sum {getSum = 124})
ghci&gt; ("dogmeat", Sum 5) `applyLog` addDrink
("beer",Sum {getSum = 35})
</pre>

<p>
Milk costs <span class="fixed">25</span> cents, but if we eat
it with beans that cost <span class="fixed">10</span> cents, we'll end up paying
<span class="fixed">35</span> cents. Now it's clear how the attached value
doesn't always have to be a log, it can be any monoid value and how two such
values are combined into one depends on the monoid. When we were doing logs,
they got appended, but now, the numbers are being added up.
</p>

<p>
Because the value that <span class="fixed">addDrink</span> returns is a tuple of
type <span class="fixed">(Food,Price)</span>, we can feed that result to <span
class="fixed">addDrink</span> again, so that it tells us what we should drink
along with our drink and how much that will cost us. Let's give it a shot:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; ("dogmeat", Sum 5) `applyLog` addDrink `applyLog` addDrink
("beer",Sum {getSum = 65})
</pre>

<p>
Adding a drink to some dog meat results in a beer and an additional
<span class="fixed">30</span> cents, so <span class="fixed">("beer", Sum 35)</span>.
And if we use <span class="fixed">applyLog</span> to feed that to <span
class="fixed">addDrink</span>, we get another beer and the result is
<span class="fixed">("beer", Sum 65)</span>.
</p>

<h3>The Writer type</h3>

<p>
Now that we've seen that a value with an attached monoid acts like a monadic
value, let's examine the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance for types of
such values.  The <span class="fixed">Control.Monad.Writer</span> module exports
the <span class="fixed">Writer w a</span> type along with its <span
class="fixed">Monad</span> instance and some useful functions for dealing with
values of this type.
</p>

<p>
First, let's examine the type itself. To attach a monoid to a value, we just
need to put them together in a tuple. The <span class="fixed">Writer w a</span>
type is just a <span class="fixed">newtype</span> wrapper for this. Its
definition is very simple:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
newtype Writer w a = Writer { runWriter :: (a, w) }
</pre>

<p>
It's wrapped in a <span class="fixed">newtype</span> so that it can be made an
instance of <span class="fixed">Monad</span> and that its type is separate from
a normal tuple. The <span class="fixed">a</span> type parameter represents the type
of the value and the <span class="fixed">w</span> type parameter the type of the
attached monoid value.
</p>

<p>
Its <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance is defined like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance (Monoid w) =&gt; Monad (Writer w) where
    return x = Writer (x, mempty)
    (Writer (x,v)) &gt;&gt;= f = let (Writer (y, v')) = f x in Writer (y, v `mappend` v')
</pre>


<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/angeleyes.png" alt="when you have to poop, poop, don't talk" class="right" width="383" height="248">
<p>
First off, let's examine <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>. Its
implementation is essentially the same as <span class="fixed">applyLog</span>,
only now that our tuple is wrapped in the <span class="fixed">Writer</span>
<span class="fixed">newtype</span>, we have to unwrap it when pattern matching.
We take the value <span class="fixed">x</span> and apply the function <span
class="fixed">f</span> to it. This gives us a <span
class="fixed">Writer w a</span> value and we use a <span
class="fixed">let</span> expression to pattern match on it. We present
<span class="fixed">y</span> as the new result and use <span
class="fixed">mappend</span> to combine the old monoid value with the new one.
We pack that up with the result value in a tuple and then wrap that with the
<span class="fixed">Writer</span> constructor so that our result is a <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> value instead of just an unwrapped tuple.
</p>

<p>
So, what about <span class="fixed">return</span>? It has to take a value and put
it in a default minimal context that still presents that value as the result. So
what would such a context be for <span class="fixed">Writer</span> values? If we
want the accompanying monoid value to affect other monoid values as little as
possible, it makes sense to use <span class="fixed">mempty</span>. <span
class="fixed">mempty</span> is used to present identity monoid values, such as
<span class="fixed">""</span> and <span class="fixed">Sum 0</span> and empty
bytestrings. Whenever we use <span class="fixed">mappend</span> between <span
class="fixed">mempty</span> and some other monoid value, the result is that
other monoid value. So if we use <span class="fixed">return</span> to make a
<span class="fixed">Writer</span> value and then use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
to feed that value to a function, the resulting monoid value will be only what
the function returns. Let's use <span class="fixed">return</span> on the number
<span class="fixed">3</span> a bunch of times, only we'll pair it with a
different monoid every time:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runWriter (return 3 :: Writer String Int)
(3,"")
ghci&gt; runWriter (return 3 :: Writer (Sum Int) Int)
(3,Sum {getSum = 0})
ghci&gt; runWriter (return 3 :: Writer (Product Int) Int)
(3,Product {getProduct = 1})
</pre>

<p>
Because <span class="fixed">Writer</span> doesn't have a <span
class="fixed">Show</span> instance, we had to use <span
class="fixed">runWriter</span> to convert our <span class="fixed">Writer</span>
values to normal tuples that can be shown. For <span
class="fixed">String</span>, the monoid value is the empty string. With <span
class="fixed">Sum</span>, it's <span class="fixed">0</span>, because if we add 0
to something, that something stays the same. For <span class="fixed">Product</span>,
the identity is <span class="fixed">1</span>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">Writer</span> instance doesn't feature an implementation
for <span class="fixed">fail</span>, so if a pattern match fails in <span
class="fixed">do</span> notation, <span class="fixed">error</span> is called.
</p>

<h3>Using do notation with Writer</h3>

<p>
Now that we have a <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance, we're free to use
<span class="fixed">do</span> notation for <span class="fixed">Writer</span>
values. It's handy for when we have a several <span class="fixed">Writer</span>
values and we want to do stuff with them. Like with other monads, we can treat
them as normal values and the context gets taken for us. In this case,
all the monoid values that come attached get <span class="fixed">mappend</span>ed
and so are reflected in the final result. Here's a simple example of using
<span class="fixed">do</span> notation with <span class="fixed">Writer</span> to
multiply two numbers:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.Writer

logNumber :: Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
logNumber x = Writer (x, ["Got number: " ++ show x])

multWithLog :: Writer [String] Int
multWithLog = do
    a &lt;- logNumber 3
    b &lt;- logNumber 5
    return (a*b)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">logNumber</span> takes a number and makes a <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> value out of it. For the monoid, we use a list of
strings and we equip the number with a singleton list that just says that we
have that number. <span class="fixed">multWithLog</span> is a <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> value which multiplies <span class="fixed">3</span>
and <span class="fixed">5</span> and makes sure that their attached logs get
included in the final log. We use <span class="fixed">return</span> to present
<span class="fixed">a*b</span> as the result. Because <span
class="fixed">return</span> just takes something and puts it in a minimal
context, we can be sure that it won't add anything to the log. Here's what we
see if we run this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runWriter multWithLog
(15,["Got number: 3","Got number: 5"])
</pre>

<p>
Sometimes we just want some monoid value to be included at some particular
point. For this, the
<span class="fixed">tell</span> function is useful. It's part of the
<span class="fixed">MonadWriter</span> type class and in the case of
<span class="fixed">Writer</span> it takes a monoid value, like <span
class="fixed">["This is going on"]</span> and creates a <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> value that presents the dummy value <span
class="fixed">()</span> as its result but has our desired monoid value attached.
When we have a monadic value that has <span class="fixed">()</span> as its
result, we don't bind it to a variable. Here's <span class="fixed">multWithLog</span>
but with some extra reporting included:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
multWithLog :: Writer [String] Int
multWithLog = do
    a &lt;- logNumber 3
    b &lt;- logNumber 5
    tell ["Gonna multiply these two"]
    return (a*b)
</pre>

<p>
It's important that <span class="fixed">return (a*b)</span> is the last line,
because the result of the last line in a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression
is the result of the whole <span class="fixed">do</span> expression. Had we
put <span class="fixed">tell</span> as the last line, <span
class="fixed">()</span> would have been the result of this <span
class="fixed">do</span> expression. We'd lose the result of the multiplication.
However, the log would be the same. Here is this in action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runWriter multWithLog
(15,["Got number: 3","Got number: 5","Gonna multiply these two"])
</pre>

<h3>Adding logging to programs</h3>

<p>
Euclid's algorithm is an algorithm that takes two numbers and computes their
greatest common divisor. That is, the biggest number that still divides both of
them. Haskell already features the <span class="fixed">gcd</span>
function, which does exactly this, but let's implement our own and then equip it
with logging capabilities. Here's the normal algorithm:
</p>



<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
gcd' :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int
gcd' a b
    | b == 0    = a
    | otherwise = gcd' b (a `mod` b)
</pre>

<p>
The algorithm is very simple. First, it checks if the second number is 0. If it
is, then the result is the first number. If it isn't, then the result is the
greatest common divisor of the second number and the remainder of dividing the
first number with the second one. For instance, if we want to know what the
greatest common divisor of 8 and 3 is, we just follow the algorithm outlined.
Because 3 isn't 0, we have to find the greatest common divisor of 3 and 2
(if we divide 8 by 3, the remainder is 2). Next, we find the greatest
common divisor of 3 and 2. 2 still isn't 0, so now we have 2 and 1. The
second number isn't 0, so we run the algorithm again for 1 and 0, as
dividing 2 by 1 gives us a remainder of 0. And finally, because the second number
is now 0, the final result is 1. Let's see if our code agrees:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; gcd' 8 3
1
</pre>

<p>
It does. Very good! Now, we want to equip our result with a context, and the
context will be a monoid value that acts as a log. Like before, we'll use a list
of strings as our monoid. So the type of our new <span class="fixed">gcd'</span>
function should be:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
gcd' :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
</pre>

<p>
All that's left now is to equip our function with log values. Here's the code:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.Writer

gcd' :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
gcd' a b
    | b == 0 = do
        tell ["Finished with " ++ show a]
        return a
    | otherwise = do
        tell [show a ++ " mod " ++ show b ++ " = " ++ show (a `mod` b)]
        gcd' b (a `mod` b)
</pre>

<p>
This function takes two normal <span class="fixed">Int</span> values and returns
a <span class="fixed">Writer [String] Int</span>, that is, an <span
class="fixed">Int</span> that has a log context. In the case where <span
class="fixed">b</span> is <span class="fixed">0</span>, instead of just giving
<span class="fixed">a</span> as the result, we use a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression
to put together a <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value as a result. First we
use <span class="fixed">tell</span> to report that we're finished and then we
use <span class="fixed">return</span> to present <span class="fixed">a</span> as
the result of the <span class="fixed">do</span> expression. Instead of this
<span class="fixed">do</span> expression, we could have also written this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
Writer (a, ["Finished with " ++ show a])
</pre>

<p>
However, I think the <span class="fixed">do</span> expression is easier to read. Next,
we have the case when <span class="fixed">b</span> isn't <span class="fixed">0</span>. In this case,
we log that we're using <span class="fixed">mod</span> to figure out the
remainder of dividing <span class="fixed">a</span> and <span
class="fixed">b</span>. Then, the second line of the <span class="fixed">do</span> expression
just recursively calls <span class="fixed">gcd'</span>. Remember, <span
class="fixed">gcd'</span> now ultimately returns a <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value,
so it's perfectly valid that <span class="fixed">gcd' b (a `mod` b)</span> is a
line in a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression.
</p>

<p>
While it may be kind of useful to trace the execution of this new <span
class="fixed">gcd'</span> by hand to see how the logs get appended, I think it's
more insightful to just look at the big picture and view these as values with a
context and from that gain insight as to what the final result will be.
</p>

<p>
Let's try our new <span class="fixed">gcd'</span> out. Its result is a
<span class="fixed">Writer [String] Int</span> value and if we unwrap that from
its <span class="fixed">newtype</span>, we get a tuple. The first part of the
tuple is the result. Let's see if it's okay:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fst $ runWriter (gcd' 8 3)
1
</pre>

<p>
Good! Now what about the log? Because the log is a list of strings, let's use
<span class="fixed">mapM_ putStrLn</span> to print those strings to the screen:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter (gcd' 8 3)
8 mod 3 = 2
3 mod 2 = 1
2 mod 1 = 0
Finished with 1
</pre>

<p>
I think it's awesome how we were able to change our ordinary algorithm to one
that reports what it does as it goes along just by changing normal values to
monadic values and letting the implementation of <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
for <span class="fixed">Writer</span> take care of the logs for us. We can add a
logging mechanism to pretty much any function. We just replace normal values
with <span class="fixed">Writer</span> values where we want and change normal function
application to <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> (or <span
class="fixed">do</span> expressions if it increases readability).
</p>

<h3>Inefficient list construction</h3>

<p>
When using the <span class="fixed">Writer</span> monad, you have to be careful
which monoid to use, because using lists can sometimes turn out to be very
slow. That's because lists use <span class="fixed">++</span> for <span class="fixed">mappend</span>
and using <span class="fixed">++</span> to add something to the end of a list is
slow if that list is really long.
</p>

<p>
In our <span class="fixed">gcd'</span> function, the logging is fast because the list
appending ends up looking like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
a ++ (b ++ (c ++ (d ++ (e ++ f))))
</pre>

<p>
Lists are a data structure that's constructed from left to right, and this is
efficient because we first fully construct the left part of a list and only
then add a longer list on the right. But if we're not careful, using the
<span class="fixed">Writer</span> monad can produce list appending that looks like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
((((a ++ b) ++ c) ++ d) ++ e) ++ f
</pre>

<p>
This associates to the left instead of to the right. This is inefficient
because every time it wants to add the right part to the left part, it has
to construct the left part all the way from the beginning!
</p>

<p>
The following function works like <span class="fixed">gcd'</span>, only it logs stuff in
reverse. First it produces the log for the rest of the procedure and then adds
the current step to the end of the log.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.Writer

gcdReverse :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer [String] Int
gcdReverse a b
    | b == 0 = do
        tell ["Finished with " ++ show a]
        return a
    | otherwise = do
        result &lt;- gcdReverse b (a `mod` b)
        tell [show a ++ " mod " ++ show b ++ " = " ++ show (a `mod` b)]
        return result
</pre>

<p>
It does the recursion first, and binds its result value to <span class="fixed">result</span>.
Then it adds the current step to the log, but the current step goes at the end
of the log that was produced by the recursion. Finally, it presents the
result of the recursion as the final result. Here it is in action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter (gcdReverse 8 3)
Finished with 1
2 mod 1 = 0
3 mod 2 = 1
8 mod 3 = 2
</pre>

<p>
It's inefficient because it ends up associating the use of <span
class="fixed">++</span> to
the left instead of to the right.
</p>

<h3>Difference lists</h3>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/cactus.png" alt="cactuses" class="left" width="147" height="300">

<p>
Because lists can sometimes be inefficient when repeatedly appended in this
manner, it's best to use a data structure that always supports efficient
appending. One such data structure is the difference list.  A difference list
is similar to a list, only instead of being a normal list, it's a function that
takes a list and prepends another list to it. The difference list equivalent of
a list like <span class="fixed">[1,2,3]</span> would be the function <span class="fixed">\xs -&gt; [1,2,3] ++ xs</span>.
A normal empty list is <span class="fixed">[]</span>, whereas an empty difference list
is the function <span class="fixed">\xs -&gt; [] ++ xs</span>.
</p>

<p>
The cool thing about difference lists is that they support efficient appending.
When we append two normal lists with <span class="fixed">++</span>, it has to
walk all the way to the end of the list on the left of <span
class="fixed">++</span> and then stick the other one there. But what if
we take the difference list approach and represent our lists as functions? Well
then, appending two difference lists can be done like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
f `append` g = \xs -&gt; f (g xs)
</pre>

<p>
Remember, <span class="fixed">f</span> and <span class="fixed">g</span> are
functions that take lists and prepend something to them. So, for instance, if
<span class="fixed">f</span> is the function <span class="fixed">("dog"++)</span> (just another
way of writing <span class="fixed">\xs -&gt; "dog" ++ xs</span>) and <span
class="fixed">g</span> the function <span class="fixed">("meat"++)</span>, then
<span class="fixed">f `append` g</span> makes a new function that's equivalent
to the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
\xs -&gt; "dog" ++ ("meat" ++ xs)
</pre>

<p>
We've appended two difference lists just by making a new function that first
applies one difference list some list and then the other.
</p>

<p>
Let's make a <span class="fixed">newtype</span> wrapper for difference lists so
that we can easily give them monoid instances:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
newtype DiffList a = DiffList { getDiffList :: [a] -&gt; [a] }
</pre>

<p>
The type that we wrap is <span class="fixed">[a] -&gt; [a]</span> because a
difference list is just a function that takes a list and returns another.
Converting normal lists to difference lists and vice versa is easy:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
toDiffList :: [a] -&gt; DiffList a
toDiffList xs = DiffList (xs++)

fromDiffList :: DiffList a -&gt; [a]
fromDiffList (DiffList f) = f []
</pre>

<p>
To make a normal list into a difference list we just do what we did before and
make it a function that prepends it to another list. Because a difference list
is a function that prepends something to another list, if we just want that
something, we apply the function to an empty list!
</p>

<p>
Here's the <span class="fixed">Monoid</span> instance:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monoid (DiffList a) where
    mempty = DiffList (\xs -&gt; [] ++ xs)
    (DiffList f) `mappend` (DiffList g) = DiffList (\xs -&gt; f (g xs))
</pre>

<p>
Notice how for lists, <span class="fixed">mempty</span> is just the
<span class="fixed">id</span> function and <span class="fixed">mappend</span> is
actually just function composition. Let's see if this works:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fromDiffList (toDiffList [1,2,3,4] `mappend` toDiffList [1,2,3])
[1,2,3,4,1,2,3]
</pre>

<p>
Tip-top! Now we can increase the efficiency of our <span
class="fixed">gcdReverse</span> function by making it use difference lists instead of normal
lists:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.Writer

gcd' :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Writer (DiffList String) Int
gcd' a b
    | b == 0 = do
        tell (toDiffList ["Finished with " ++ show a])
        return a
    | otherwise = do
        result &lt;- gcd' b (a `mod` b)
        tell (toDiffList [show a ++ " mod " ++ show b ++ " = " ++ show (a `mod` b)])
        return result
</pre>

<p>
We only had to change the type of the monoid from <span class="fixed">[String]</span>
to <span class="fixed">DiffList String</span> and then when using
<span class="fixed">tell</span>, convert our normal lists into difference lists
with <span class="fixed">toDiffList</span>. Let's see if the log gets assembled
properly:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn . fromDiffList . snd . runWriter $ gcdReverse 110 34
Finished with 2
8 mod 2 = 0
34 mod 8 = 2
110 mod 34 = 8
</pre>

<p>
We do <span class="fixed">gcdReverse 110 34</span>, then use <span class="fixed">runWriter</span>
to unwrap it from the <span class="fixed">newtype</span>, then apply <span
class="fixed">snd</span> to that to just get the log, then apply <span
class="fixed">fromDiffList</span> to convert it to a normal list and then
finally print its entries to the screen.
</p>

<h3>Comparing Performance</h3>

<p>
To get a feel for just how much difference lists may improve your performance,
consider this function that just counts down from some number to zero, but
produces its log in reverse, like <span class="fixed">gcdReverse</span>, so that the numbers
in the log will actually be counted up:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
finalCountDown :: Int -&gt; Writer (DiffList String) ()
finalCountDown 0 = do
    tell (toDiffList ["0"])
finalCountDown x = do
    finalCountDown (x-1)
    tell (toDiffList [show x])
</pre>

<p>
If we give it <span class="fixed">0</span>, it just logs it. For any other number, it
first counts down its predecessor to <span class="fixed">0</span> and then appends
that number to the log. So if we apply <span class="fixed">finalCountDown</span> to
<span class="fixed">100</span>, the string <span class="fixed">"100"</span> will come last in the
log.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, if you load this function in GHCi and apply it to a big number,
like <span class="fixed">500000</span>, you'll see that it quickly starts counting from
<span class="fixed">0</span> onwards:

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn . fromDiffList . snd . runWriter $ finalCountDown 500000
0
1
2
...
</pre>

<p>
However, if we change it to use normal lists instead of difference lists, like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
finalCountDown :: Int -&gt; Writer [String] ()
finalCountDown 0 = do
    tell ["0"]
finalCountDown x = do
    finalCountDown (x-1)
    tell [show x]
</pre>

<p>
And then tell GHCi to start counting:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn . snd . runWriter $ finalCountDown 500000
</pre>

<p>
We'll see that the counting is really slow.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is not the proper and scientific way to test how fast our
programs are, but we were able to see that in this case, using difference lists
starts producing results right away whereas normal lists take forever.
</p>

<p>
Oh, by the way, the song Final Countdown by Europe is now stuck in your head.
Enjoy!

<h2>Reader? Ugh, not this joke again.</h2>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/revolver.png" alt="bang you're dead" class="left" width="280"
height="106">

<p>
In the <a href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html">chapter about
applicatives</a>, we saw
that the function type, <span class="fixed">(-&gt;) r</span> is an instance of
<span class="fixed">Functor</span>. Mapping a function <span
class="fixed">f</span> over a function <span class="fixed">g</span> will make a
function that takes the same thing as <span class="fixed">g</span>, applies
<span class="fixed">g</span> to it and then applies <span class="fixed">f</span>
to that result. So basically, we're making a new function that's like <span
class="fixed">g</span>, only before returning its result, <span
class="fixed">f</span> gets applied to that result as well. For instance:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let f = (*5)
ghci&gt; let g = (+3)
ghci&gt; (fmap f g) 8
55
</pre>

<p>
We've also seen that functions are applicative functors. They allow us to
operate on the eventual results of functions as if we already had their results.
Here's an example:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let f = (+) &lt;$&gt; (*2) &lt;*&gt; (+10)
ghci&gt; f 3
19
</pre>

<p>
The expression <span class="fixed">(+) &lt;$&gt; (*2) &lt;*&gt; (+10)</span>
makes a function that takes a number, gives that number to <span
class="fixed">(*2)</span> and <span class="fixed">(+10)</span> and then adds
together the results. For instance, if we apply this function to <span
class="fixed">3</span>, it applies both <span class="fixed">(*2)</span> and
<span class="fixed">(+10)</span> to <span class="fixed">3</span>, giving
<span class="fixed">6</span> and <span class="fixed">13</span>. Then, it calls
<span class="fixed">(+)</span> with <span class="fixed">6</span> and
<span class="fixed">13</span> and the result is <span class="fixed">19</span>.
</p>

<p>
Not only is the function type <span class="fixed">(-&gt;) r</span> a functor
and an applicative functor, but it's also a monad. Just like other monadic
values that we've met so far, a function can also be considered a value with
a context. The context for functions is that that value is not present yet and
that we have to apply that function to something in order to get its result
value.
</p>

<p>
Because we're already acquainted with how functions work as functors and
applicative functors, let's dive right in and see what their
<span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance looks like. It's located in
<span class="fixed">Control.Monad.Instances</span> and it goes a little
something like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad ((-&gt;) r) where
    return x = \_ -&gt; x
    h &gt;&gt;= f = \w -&gt; f (h w) w
</pre>

<p>
We've already seen how <span class="fixed">pure</span> is implemented for
functions, and <span class="fixed">return</span> is pretty much the same thing
as <span class="fixed">pure</span>. It takes a value and puts it in a minimal
context that always has that value as its result. And the only way to make a
function that always has a certain value as its result is to make it completely
ignore its parameter.
</p>

<p>
The implementation for <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> seems a bit cryptic,
but it's really not all that. When we use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
to feed a monadic value to a function, the result is always a monadic value. So
in this case, when we feed a function to another function, the result is a
function as well. That's why the result starts off as a lambda. All of the
implementations of <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> so far always somehow
isolated the result from the monadic value and then applied the function
<span class="fixed">f</span> to that result. The same thing happens here. To get
the result from a function, we have to apply it to something, which is why we do
<span class="fixed">(h w)</span> here to get the result from the function and
then we apply <span class="fixed">f</span> to that. <span class="fixed">f</span>
returns a monadic value, which is a function in our case, so we apply it to
<span class="fixed">w</span> as well.
</p>

<p>
If you don't understand how <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> works at this point, don't
worry, because with examples we'll see how this is a really simple monad. Here's
a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression that utilizes this monad:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.Instances

addStuff :: Int -&gt; Int
addStuff = do
    a &lt;- (*2)
    b &lt;- (+10)
    return (a+b)
</pre>

<p>
This is the same thing as the applicative expression that we wrote earlier, only
now it relies on functions being monads. A <span class="fixed">do</span>
expression always results in a monadic value and this one is no different. The
result of this monadic value is a function. What happens here is that it takes a
number and then <span class="fixed">(*2)</span> gets applied to that number and
the result becomes <span class="fixed">a</span>. <span class="fixed">(+10)</span> is applied to the same number that
<span class="fixed">(*2)</span> got applied to and the result becomes <span
class="fixed">b</span>. <span class="fixed">return</span>, like in other monads,
doesn't have any other effect but to make a monadic value that presents some
result. This presents <span class="fixed">a+b</span> as the result of this
function. If we test it out, we get the same result as before:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; addStuff 3
19
</pre>

<p>
Both <span class="fixed">(*2)</span> and <span class="fixed">(+10)</span> get
applied to the number <span class="fixed">3</span> in this case. <span
class="fixed">return (a+b)</span> does as well, but it ignores it and always
presents <span class="fixed">a+b</span> as the result. For this reason, the
function monad is also called the reader monad. All the functions read from a
common source. To illustrate this even better, we can rewrite
<span class="fixed">addStuff</span> like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
addStuff :: Int -&gt; Int
addStuff x = let
    a = (*2) x
    b = (+10) x
    in a+b
</pre>

<p>
We see that the reader monad allows us to treat functions as values with a
context. We can act as if we already know what the functions will return. It
does this by gluing functions together into one function and then giving that
function's parameter to all of the functions that it was glued from. So if we
have a lot of functions that are all just missing one parameter and they'd
eventually be applied to the same thing, we can use the reader monad to sort of
extract their future results and the <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
implementation will make sure that it all works out.
</p>

<a name="state"></a>
<h2>Tasteful stateful computations</h2>
<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/texas.png" alt="don't jest with texas" class="left" width="244"
height="230">

<p>
Haskell is a pure language and because of that, our programs are made of
functions that can't change any global state or variables,
they can only do some computations and return them results. This restriction
actually makes it easier to think about our programs, as it frees us from
worrying what every variable's value is at some point in time. However, some
problems are inherently stateful in that they rely on some state that changes
over time. While such problems aren't a problem for Haskell, they can be a bit
tedious to model sometimes. That's why Haskell features a thing called the state
monad, which makes dealing with stateful problems a breeze while still keeping
everything nice and pure.
</p>

<p>
<a href="input-and-output.html#randomness">When we were dealing with random numbers</a>, we dealt with functions that took a
random generator as a parameter and returned a random number and a new random
generator. If we wanted to generate several random numbers, we always had to use
the random generator that a previous function returned along with its result.
When making a function that takes a <span class="fixed">StdGen</span> and tosses
a coin three times based on that generator, we had to do this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
threeCoins :: StdGen -&gt; (Bool, Bool, Bool)
threeCoins gen =
    let (firstCoin, newGen) = random gen
        (secondCoin, newGen') = random newGen
        (thirdCoin, newGen'') = random newGen'
    in  (firstCoin, secondCoin, thirdCoin)
</pre>

<p>
It took a generator <span class="fixed">gen</span> and then <span
class="fixed">random gen</span> returned a <span class="fixed">Bool</span> value
along with a new generator. To throw the second coin, we used the new generator,
and so on. In most other languages, we wouldn't have to return a new generator
along with a random number. We could just modify the existing one! But since
Haskell is pure, we can't do that, so we had to take some state, make a result
from it and a new state and then use that new state to generate new results.
</p>

<p>
You'd think that to avoid manually dealing with stateful computations in this
way, we'd have to give up the purity of Haskell. Well, we don't have to, since
there exist a special little monad called the state monad which handles all this
state business for us and without giving up any of the purity that makes Haskell
programming so cool.
</p>

<p>
So, to help us understand this concept of stateful computations better, let's go
ahead and give them a type. We'll say that a stateful computation is a function
that takes some state and returns a value along with some new state. That
function would have the following type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
s -&gt; (a,s)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">s</span> is the type of the state and <span
class="fixed">a</span> the result of the stateful computations.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
Assignment in most other languages could be thought of as a stateful
computation. For instance, when we do <span class="fixed">x = 5</span> in an
imperative language, it will usually assign the value <span
class="fixed">5</span> to the variable <span class="fixed">x</span> and it will
also have the value <span class="fixed">5</span> as an expression. If you look
at that functionally, you could look at it as a function that takes a state
(that is, all the variables that have been assigned previously) and returns a
result (in this case <span class="fixed">5</span>) and a new state, which would
be all the previous variable mappings plus the newly assigned variable.
</div>

<p>
This stateful computation, a function that takes a state
and returns a result and a new state, can be thought of as a value with a
context as well. The actual value is the result, whereas the context is that we
have to provide some initial state to actually get that result and that apart
from getting a result we also get a new state.
</p>

<h3>Stacks and stones</h3>

<p>
Say we want to model operating a stack. You have a stack of things one on top
of another and you can either push stuff on top of that stack or you can take stuff
off the top of the stack. When you're putting an item on top of the stack we say
that you're pushing it to the stack and when you're taking stuff off the
top we say that you're popping it. If you want something that's at the bottom
of the stack, you have to pop everything that's above it.
</p>

<p>
We'll use a list to represent our stack and the head of the list will be the top
of the stack. To help us with our task, we'll make two functions: <span
class="fixed">pop</span> and <span class="fixed">push</span>. <span
class="fixed">pop</span> will take a stack, pop one item and return that item as
the result and also return a new stack, without that item. <span
class="fixed">push</span> will take an item and a stack and then push that item
onto the stack. It will return <span class="fixed">()</span> as its result,
along with a new stack. Here goes:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Stack = [Int]

pop :: Stack -&gt; (Int,Stack)
pop (x:xs) = (x,xs)

push :: Int -&gt; Stack -&gt; ((),Stack)
push a xs = ((),a:xs)
</pre>

<p>
We used <span class="fixed">()</span> as the result when pushing to the stack
because pushing an item onto the stack doesn't have any important result value,
its main job is to change the stack. Notice how we just apply the first parameter of <span class="fixed">push</span>, we get a stateful
computation. <span class="fixed">pop</span> is already a stateful computation
because of its type.
</p>

<p>
Let's write a small piece of code to simulate a stack using these functions.
We'll take a stack, push <span class="fixed">3</span> to it and then pop two
items, just for kicks. Here it is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
stackManip :: Stack -&gt; (Int, Stack)
stackManip stack = let
    ((),newStack1) = push 3 stack
    (a ,newStack2) = pop newStack1
    in pop newStack2
</pre>

<p>
We take a <span class="fixed">stack</span> and then we do <span
class="fixed">push 3 stack</span>, which results in a tuple. The first part of
the tuple is a <span class="fixed">()</span> and the second is a new stack and
we call it <span class="fixed">newStack1</span>.
Then, we pop a number from <span class="fixed">newStack1</span>, which results
in a number <span class="fixed">a</span> (which is the <span
class="fixed">3</span>) that we pushed and a new stack which we call
<span class="fixed">newStack2</span>. Then, we pop a number off
<span class="fixed">newStack2</span> and we get a number that's <span
class="fixed">b</span> and a <span class="fixed">newStack3</span>. We return a
tuple with that number and that stack. Let's try it out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; stackManip [5,8,2,1]
(5,[8,2,1])
</pre>

<p>
Cool, the result is <span class="fixed">5</span> and the new stack is
<span class="fixed">[8,2,1]</span>. Notice how <span class="fixed">stackManip</span>
is itself a stateful computation. We've taken a bunch of stateful computations
and we've sort of glued them together. Hmm, sounds familiar.
</p>
<p>
The above code for
<span class="fixed">stackManip</span> is kind of tedious since we're manually
giving the state to every stateful computation and storing it and then giving it
to the next one. Wouldn't it be cooler if, instead of giving the stack manually
to each function, we could write something like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
stackManip = do
    push 3
    a &lt;- pop
    pop
</pre>

<p>
Well, using the state monad will allow us to do exactly this. With it, we will
be able to take stateful computations like these and use them without having to manage
the state manually.
</p>

<h3>The State monad</h3>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">Control.Monad.State</span> module provides a <span
class="fixed">newtype</span> that wraps stateful computations. Here's its definition:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -&gt; (a,s) }
</pre>

<p>
A <span class="fixed">State s a</span> is a stateful computation that
manipulates a state of type <span class="fixed">s</span> and has a result of
type <span class="fixed">a</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've seen what stateful computations are about and how they can even be
thought of as values with contexts, let's check out their <span
class="fixed">Monad</span> instance:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad (State s) where
    return x = State $ \s -&gt; (x,s)
    (State h) &gt;&gt;= f = State $ \s -&gt; let (a, newState) = h s
                                        (State g) = f a
                                    in  g newState
</pre>

<p>
Let's take a gander at <span class="fixed">return</span> first. Our aim
with <span class="fixed">return</span> is to take a value and make a stateful
computation that always has that value as its result. That's why we just make a
lambda <span class="fixed">\s -&gt; (x,s)</span>. We always present <span
class="fixed">x</span> as the
result of the stateful computation and the state is kept unchanged, because
<span class="fixed">return</span> has to put a value in a minimal context. So
<span class="fixed">return</span> will make a stateful computation that presents
a certain value as the result and keeps the state unchanged.
</p>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/badge.png" alt="im a cop" class="right" width="182" height="160">

<p>
What about <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>? Well, the result of feeding a
stateful computation to a function with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> has to be a
stateful computation, right? So we start off with the <span class="fixed">State</span>
<span class="fixed">newtype</span> wrapper and then we type out a lambda. This
lambda will be our new stateful computation. But what goes on in it? Well, we
somehow have to extract the result value from the first stateful computation.
Because we're in a stateful computation right now, we can give the stateful
computation <span class="fixed">h</span> our current state <span
class="fixed">s</span>, which results in a pair of result and a new state:
<span class="fixed">(a, newState)</span>. Every time so far when we were
implementing <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, once we had the extracted
the result from the monadic value, we applied the function
<span class="fixed">f</span> to it to get the new monadic value. In
<span class="fixed">Writer</span>, after doing that and getting the new monadic
value, we still had to make sure that the context was taken care of by
<span class="fixed">mappend</span>ing the old monoid value with the new one.
Here, we do <span class="fixed">f a</span> and we get a new stateful computation
<span class="fixed">g</span>. Now that we have a new stateful computation and a
new state (goes by the name of <span class="fixed">newState</span>) we just
apply that stateful computation <span class="fixed">g</span> to the <span
class="fixed">newState</span>. The result is a tuple of final result and final
state!
</p>

<p>
So with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, we kind of glue two stateful
computations together, only the second one is hidden inside a function that
takes the previous one's result. Because <span class="fixed">pop</span> and
<span class="fixed">push</span> are already stateful computations, it's easy to
wrap them into a <span class="fixed">State</span> wrapper. Watch:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.State

pop :: State Stack Int
pop = State $ \(x:xs) -&gt; (x,xs)

push :: Int -&gt; State Stack ()
push a = State $ \xs -&gt; ((),a:xs)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">pop</span> is already a stateful computation and
<span class="fixed">push</span> takes an <span class="fixed">Int</span> and
returns a stateful computation. Now we can rewrite our previous example of
pushing <span class="fixed">3</span> onto the stack and then popping two numbers
off like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Control.Monad.State

stackManip :: State Stack Int
stackManip = do
    push 3
    a &lt;- pop
    pop
</pre>

<p>
See how we've glued a push and two pops into one stateful computation? When we
unwrap it from its <span class="fixed">newtype</span> wrapper we get a function
to which we can provide some initial state:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runState stackManip [5,8,2,1]
(5,[8,2,1])
</pre>

<p>
We didn't have to bind the second <span class="fixed">pop</span> to <span
class="fixed">a</span> because we didn't use that <span class="fixed">a</span>
at all. So we could have written it like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
stackManip :: State Stack Int
stackManip = do
    push 3
    pop
    pop
</pre>

<p>
Pretty cool. But what if we want to do this: pop one number off the stack and
then if that number is <span class="fixed">5</span> we just put it back onto the
stack and stop but if it isn't <span class="fixed">5</span>, we push <span
class="fixed">3</span> and <span class="fixed">8</span> back on? Well, here's
the code:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
stackStuff :: State Stack ()
stackStuff = do
    a &lt;- pop
    if a == 5
        then push 5
        else do
            push 3
            push 8
</pre>

<p>
This is quite straightforward. Let's run it with an initial stack.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runState stackStuff [9,0,2,1,0]
((),[8,3,0,2,1,0])
</pre>

<p>
Remember, <span class="fixed">do</span> expressions result in monadic values and
with the <span class="fixed">State</span> monad, a single <span
class="fixed">do</span> expression is also a stateful function. Because
<span class="fixed">stackManip</span> and <span class="fixed">stackStuff</span>
are ordinary stateful computations, we can glue them together to produce further
stateful computations.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
moreStack :: State Stack ()
moreStack = do
    a &lt;- stackManip
    if a == 100
        then stackStuff
        else return ()
</pre>

<p>
If the result of <span class="fixed">stackManip</span> on the current stack
is <span class="fixed">100</span>, we run <span class="fixed">stackStuff</span>,
otherwise we do nothing. <span class="fixed">return ()</span> just keeps the
state as it is and does nothing.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">Control.Monad.State</span> module provides a type class
that's called <span class="fixed">MonadState</span> and it features two pretty
useful functions, namely <span class="fixed">get</span> and <span
class="fixed">put</span>. For <span class="fixed">State</span>, the <span
class="fixed">get</span> function is implemented like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
get = State $ \s -&gt; (s,s)
</pre>

<p>
So it just takes the current state and presents it as the result. The
<span class="fixed">put</span> function takes some state and makes a stateful
function that replaces the current state with it:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
put newState = State $ \s -&gt; ((),newState)
</pre>

<p>
So with these, we can see what the current stack is or we can replace it with a
whole other stack. Like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
stackyStack :: State Stack ()
stackyStack = do
    stackNow &lt;- get
    if stackNow == [1,2,3]
        then put [8,3,1]
        else put [9,2,1]
</pre>

<p>
It's worth examining what the type of <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> would
be if it only worked for <span class="fixed">State</span> values:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&gt;&gt;=) :: State s a -&gt; (a -&gt; State s b) -&gt; State s b
</pre>

<p>
See how the type of the state <span class="fixed">s</span> stays the same but
the type of the result can change from <span class="fixed">a</span> to
<span class="fixed">b</span>? This means that we can glue together several
stateful computations whose results are of different types but the type of the
state has to stay the same. Now why is that? Well, for instance, for <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span>, <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> has this type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&gt;&gt;=) :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
</pre>

<p>
It makes sense that the monad itself, <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>, doesn't
change. It wouldn't make sense to use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
between two different monads. Well, for the state monad, the monad is actually <span
class="fixed">State s</span>, so if that <span class="fixed">s</span> was
different, we'd be using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> between two
different monads.
</p>

<h3>Randomness and the state monad</h3>

<p>
At the beginning of this section, we saw how generating numbers can sometimes be
awkward because every random function takes a generator and returns a random
number along with a new generator, which must then be used instead of the old
one if we want to generate another random number. The state monad makes dealing
with this a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">random</span> function from <span class="fixed">System.Random</span>
has the following type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
random :: (RandomGen g, Random a) =&gt; g -&gt; (a, g)
</pre>

<p>
Meaning it takes a random generator and produces a random number along with a
new generator. We can see that it's a stateful computation, so we can wrap it in
the <span class="fixed">State</span> <span class="fixed">newtype</span>
constructor and then use it as a monadic value so that passing of the state gets
handled for us:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import System.Random
import Control.Monad.State

randomSt :: (RandomGen g, Random a) =&gt; State g a
randomSt = State random
</pre>

<p>
So now if we want to throw three coins (<span class="fixed">True</span> is
tails, <span class="fixed">False</span> is heads) we just do the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import System.Random
import Control.Monad.State

threeCoins :: State StdGen (Bool,Bool,Bool)
threeCoins = do
    a &lt;- randomSt
    b &lt;- randomSt
    c &lt;- randomSt
    return (a,b,c)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">threeCoins</span> is now a stateful computation and after
taking an initial random generator, it passes it to the first <span
class="fixed">randomSt</span>, which produces a number and a new generator,
which gets passed to the next one and so on. We use <span class="fixed">return
(a,b,c)</span> to present <span class="fixed">(a,b,c)</span> as the result
without changing the most recent generator. Let's give this a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runState threeCoins (mkStdGen 33)
((True,False,True),680029187 2103410263)
</pre>

<p>
Nice. Doing these sort of things that require some state to be kept in between
steps just became much less of a hassle!
</p>

<a name="error"></a>
<h2>Error error on the wall</h2>

<p>
We know by now that <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> is used to add a
context of possible failure to values. A value can be a
<span class="fixed">Just something</span> or a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
However useful it may be, when we have a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, all
we know is that there was some sort of failure, but there's no way to cram
some more info in there telling us what kind of failure it was or why it failed.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">Either e a</span> type on the other hand, allows us to
incorporate a context of possible failure to our values while also being able to
attach values to the failure, so that they can describe what went wrong or
provide some other useful info regarding the failure. An <span
class="fixed">Either e a</span> value can either be a <span
class="fixed">Right</span> value, signifying the right answer and a success, or
it can be a <span class="fixed">Left</span> value, signifying failure. For
instance:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :t Right 4
Right 4 :: (Num t) =&gt; Either a t
ghci&gt; :t Left "out of cheese error"
Left "out of cheese error" :: Either [Char] b
</pre>

<p>
This is pretty much just an enhanced <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>,
so it makes sense for it to be a monad, because it can also be viewed as a value
with an added context of possible failure, only now there's a value attached
when there's an error as well.
</p>

<p>
Its <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance is similar to that of <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> and it can be found in <span class="fixed">Control.Monad.Error</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance (Error e) =&gt; Monad (Either e) where
    return x = Right x
    Right x &gt;&gt;= f = f x
    Left err &gt;&gt;= f = Left err
    fail msg = Left (strMsg msg)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">return</span>, as always, takes a value and puts it in a
default minimal context. It wraps our value in the <span class="fixed">Right</span>
constructor because we're using <span class="fixed">Right</span> to represent a
successful computation where a result is present. This is a lot like <span
class="fixed">return</span> for <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> examines two possible cases: a
<span class="fixed">Left</span> and a <span class="fixed">Right</span>. In the
case of a <span class="fixed">Right</span>, the function <span
class="fixed">f</span> is applied to the value inside it, similar to how in the
case of a <span class="fixed">Just</span>, the function is just applied to its
contents. In the case of an error, the <span class="fixed">Left</span> value is
kept, along with its contents, which describe the failure.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance for <span class="fixed">Either
e</span> makes an
additional requirement, and that is that the type of the value contained in a
<span class="fixed">Left</span>, the one that's indexed by the <span class="fixed">e</span>
type parameter, has to be an instance of the <span class="fixed">Error</span>
type class. The <span class="fixed">Error</span> type class is for types whose
values can act like error messages. It defines the <span class="fixed">strMsg</span> function, which takes
an error in the form of a string and returns such a value. A good example of an
<span class="fixed">Error</span> instance is, well, the <span
class="fixed">String</span> type! In the case of <span class="fixed">String</span>, the <span class="fixed">strMsg</span>
function just returns the string that it got:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; :t strMsg
strMsg :: (Error a) =&gt; String -&gt; a
ghci&gt; strMsg "boom!" :: String
"boom!"
</pre>

<p>
But since we usually use <span class="fixed">String</span> to describe the error
when using <span class="fixed">Either</span>, we don't have to worry about this
too much. When a pattern match fails in <span class="fixed">do</span> notation,
a <span class="fixed">Left</span> value is used to signify this failure.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, here are a few examples of usage:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Left "boom" &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x+1)
Left "boom"
ghci&gt; Right 100 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; Left "no way!"
Left "no way!"
</pre>

<p>
When we use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed a <span
class="fixed">Left</span> value to a function,
the function is ignored and an identical <span class="fixed">Left</span> value
is returned. When we feed a <span class="fixed">Right</span> value to a function,
the function gets applied to what's on the inside, but in this case that
function produced a <span class="fixed">Left</span> value anyway!
</p>

<p>
When we try to feed a <span class="fixed">Right</span> value to a function that
also succeeds, we're tripped up by a peculiar type error! Hmmm.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Right 3 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x + 100)

&lt;interactive&gt;:1:0:
    Ambiguous type variable `a' in the constraints:
      `Error a' arising from a use of `it' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-33
      `Show a' arising from a use of `print' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-33
    Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
</pre>

<p>
Haskell says that it doesn't know which type to choose for the
<span class="fixed">e</span> part of our <span class="fixed">Either e a</span>
typed value, even though we're just printing the <span class="fixed">Right</span> part.
This is due to the <span class="fixed">Error e</span> constraint on the
<span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance. So if you get type errors like this
one when using <span class="fixed">Either</span> as a monad, just add an
explicit type signature:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Right 3 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x + 100) :: Either String Int
Right 103
</pre>

<p>
Alright, now it works!
</p>

<p>
Other than this little hangup, using this monad is very similar to using
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> as a monad. In the previous chapter, we used
the monadic aspects of <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> to simulate birds
landing on the balancing pole of a tightrope walker. As an exercise, you can
rewrite that with the error monad so that when the
tightrope walker slips and falls, we remember how many birds were on each side of
the pole when he fell.
</p>

<a name="useful-monadic-functions"></a>
<h2>Some useful monadic functions</h2>


<p>
In this section, we're going to explore a few functions that either operate on
monadic values or return monadic values as their results (or both!). Such
functions are usually referred to as monadic functions. While some of them will
be brand new, others will be monadic counterparts of functions that we already
know, like <span class="fixed">filter</span> and <span class="fixed">foldl</span>.
Let's see what they are then!
</p>

<h3>liftM and friends</h3>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/wolf.png" alt="im a cop too" class="right" width="394" height="222">

<p>
When we started our journey to the top of Monad Mountain, we first looked
at functors, which are for things that can be mapped over. Then, we learned
about improved functors called applicative functors, which allowed us to apply
normal functions between several applicative values as well as to take a normal
value and put it in some default context. Finally, we introduced
monads as improved applicative functors, which added the ability for these
values with context to somehow be fed into normal functions.
</p>

<p>
So every monad is an applicative functor and every applicative functor is a
functor. The <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class has a class
constraint such that our type has to be an instance of <span
class="fixed">Functor</span> before we can make it an instance of <span
class="fixed">Applicative</span>. But even though <span class="fixed">Monad</span> should have the same
constraint for <span class="fixed">Applicative</span>, as every monad is an
applicative functor, it doesn't, because the <span class="fixed">Monad</span>
type class was introduced to Haskell way before <span class="fixed">Applicative</span>.
</p>

<p>
But even though every monad is a functor, we don't have to rely on it having a
<span class="fixed">Functor</span> instance because of the <span
class="fixed">liftM</span> function. <span class="fixed">liftM</span> takes a
function and a monadic value and maps it over the monadic value. So it's pretty
much the same thing as <span class="fixed">fmap</span>! This is
<span class="fixed">liftM</span>'s type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
</pre>

<p>
And this is the type of <span class="fixed">fmap</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fmap :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>

<p>
If the <span class="fixed">Functor</span> and <span class="fixed">Monad</span>
instances for a type obey the functor and monad laws, these two amount to the
same thing (and all the monads that we've met so far obey both). This is kind of
like <span class="fixed">pure</span> and <span class="fixed">return</span> do
the same thing, only one has an <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> class
constraint whereas the other has a <span class="fixed">Monad</span> one. Let's
try <span class="fixed">liftM</span> out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; liftM (*3) (Just 8)
Just 24
ghci&gt; fmap (*3) (Just 8)
Just 24
ghci&gt; runWriter $ liftM not $ Writer (True, "chickpeas")
(False,"chickpeas")
ghci&gt; runWriter $ fmap not $ Writer (True, "chickpeas")
(False,"chickpeas")
ghci&gt; runState (liftM (+100) pop) [1,2,3,4]
(101,[2,3,4])
ghci&gt; runState (fmap (+100) pop) [1,2,3,4]
(101,[2,3,4])
</pre>

<p>
We already know quite well how <span class="fixed">fmap</span> works with <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> values. And <span class="fixed">liftM</span> does the
same thing. For <span class="fixed">Writer</span> values, the function is mapped
over the first component of the tuple, which is the result. Doing <span
class="fixed">fmap</span> or <span class="fixed">liftM</span> over a stateful
computation results in another stateful computation, only its eventual result is modified
by the supplied function. Had we not mapped <span class="fixed">(+100)</span> over
<span class="fixed">pop</span> in this case before running it, it would have
returned <span class="fixed">(1,[2,3,4])</span>.
</p>

<p>
This is how <span class="fixed">liftM</span> is implemented:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
liftM f m = m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return (f x))
</pre>

<p>
Or with <span class="fixed">do</span> notation:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
liftM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
liftM f m = do
    x &lt;- m
    return (f x)
</pre>

<p>
We feed the monadic value <span class="fixed">m</span> into the function and
then we apply the function <span class="fixed">f</span> to its result before
putting it back into a default context. Because of the monad laws, this is
guaranteed not to change the context, only the result that the monadic value
presents. We see that <span class="fixed">liftM</span> is implemented without
referencing the <span class="fixed">Functor</span> type class at all. This means
that we can implement <span class="fixed">fmap</span> (or <span
class="fixed">liftM</span>, whatever you want to call it) just by using the
goodies that monads offer us. Because of this, we can conclude that monads are
stronger than just regular old functors.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class allows us to apply
functions between values with contexts as if they were normal values. Like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (+) &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 5
Just 8
ghci&gt; (+) &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Using this applicative style makes things pretty easy. <span
class="fixed">&lt;$&gt;</span> is just <span class="fixed">fmap</span> and
<span class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span> is a function from the
<span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class that has the following type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&lt;*&gt;) :: (Applicative f) =&gt; f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>

<p>
So it's kind of like <span class="fixed">fmap</span>, only the function itself
is in a context. We have to somehow extract it from the context and map it over
the <span class="fixed">f a</span> value and then assemble the context back
together. Because all functions are curried in Haskell by default, we can use
the combination of <span class="fixed">&lt;$&gt;</span> and <span
class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span> to apply functions that take several parameters
between applicative values.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, it turns out that just like <span class="fixed">fmap</span>, <span
class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span> can also be implemented by using only what the
<span class="fixed">Monad</span> type class give us. The <span
class="fixed">ap</span> function is basically <span class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span>, only it has a
<span class="fixed">Monad</span> constraint instead of an <span
class="fixed">Applicative</span> one. Here's its definition:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ap :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
ap mf m = do
    f &lt;- mf
    x &lt;- m
    return (f x)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">mf</span> is a monadic value whose result is a function.
Because the function is in a context as well as the value, we get the function
from the context and call it <span class="fixed">f</span>, then get the value
and call that <span class="fixed">x</span> and then finally apply the function
to the value and present that as a result. Here's a quick demonstration:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 4
Just 7
ghci&gt; Just (+3) `ap` Just 4
Just 7
ghci&gt; [(+1),(+2),(+3)] &lt;*&gt; [10,11]
[11,12,12,13,13,14]
ghci&gt; [(+1),(+2),(+3)] `ap` [10,11]
[11,12,12,13,13,14]
</pre>

<p>
Now we see that monads are stronger than applicatives as well, because we can
use the functions from <span class="fixed">Monad</span> to implement the ones
for <span class="fixed">Applicative</span>. In fact, many times when a type is
found to be a monad, people first write up a <span class="fixed">Monad</span>
instance and then make an <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> instance by just
saying that <span class="fixed">pure</span> is <span class="fixed">return</span>
and <span class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span> is <span class="fixed">ap</span>.
Similarly, if you already have a <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance for
something, you can give it a <span class="fixed">Functor</span> instance just
saying that <span class="fixed">fmap</span> is <span class="fixed">liftM</span>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">liftA2</span> function is a convenience function for
applying a function between two applicative values. It's defined simply like
so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
liftA2 :: (Applicative f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b -&gt; f c
liftA2 f x y = f &lt;$&gt; x &lt;*&gt; y
</pre>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">liftM2</span> function does the same thing, only it has
a <span class="fixed">Monad</span> constraint. There also exist <span
class="fixed">liftM3</span> and <span class="fixed">liftM4</span> and
<span class="fixed">liftM5</span>.
</p>

<p>
We saw how monads are stronger than applicatives and functors and how even
though all monads are functors and applicative functors, they don't necessarily
have <span class="fixed">Functor</span> and <span class="fixed">Applicative</span>
instances, so we examined the monadic equivalents of the functions that functors
and applicative functors use.
</p>

<h3>The join function</h3>

<p>
Here's some food for thought: if the result of one monadic value is another
monadic value i.e. if one monadic value is nested inside the other, can you
flatten them to just a single normal monadic value? Like, if we have
<span class="fixed">Just (Just 9)</span>, can we make that into <span
class="fixed">Just 9</span>? It turns out that any nested monadic value can be
flattened and that this is actually a property unique to monads. For this, the
<span class="fixed">join</span> function exists. Its type is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
join :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a
</pre>

<p>
So it takes a monadic value within a monadic value and gives us just a monadic
value, so it sort of flattens it. Here it is with some <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> values:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; join (Just (Just 9))
Just 9
ghci&gt; join (Just Nothing)
Nothing
ghci&gt; join Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
The first line has a successful computation as a result of a successful
computation, so they're both just joined into one big successful computation.
The second line features a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> as a result of a
<span class="fixed">Just</span> value. Whenever we were dealing with <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> values before and we wanted to combine several of
them into one, be it with <span class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span> or <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, they all had to be <span class="fixed">Just</span> values
for the result to be a <span class="fixed">Just</span> value. If there was any
failure along the way, the result was a failure and the same thing happens here.
In the third line, we try to flatten what is from the onset a failure, so the
result is a failure as well.
</p>


<p>
Flattening lists is pretty intuitive:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; join [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
</pre>

<p>
As you can see, for lists, <span class="fixed">join</span> is just
<span class="fixed">concat</span>. To flatten a <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value
whose result is a <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value itself, we have to
<span class="fixed">mappend</span> the monoid value.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runWriter $ join (Writer (Writer (1,"aaa"),"bbb"))
(1,"bbbaaa")
</pre>

<p>
The outer monoid value
<span class="fixed">"bbb"</span> comes first and then to it <span
class="fixed">"aaa"</span> is appended. Intuitively speaking, when you want to
examine what the result of a <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value is, you
have to write its monoid value to the log first and only then can you examine
what it has inside.
</p>

<p>
Flattening <span class="fixed">Either</span> values is very similar to
flattening <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; join (Right (Right 9)) :: Either String Int
Right 9
ghci&gt; join (Right (Left "error")) :: Either String Int
Left "error"
ghci&gt; join (Left "error") :: Either String Int
Left "error"
</pre>


<p>
If we apply <span class="fixed">join</span> to a stateful computation whose
result is a stateful computation, the result is a stateful computation that
first runs the outer stateful computation and then the resulting one. Watch:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; runState (join (State $ \s -&gt; (push 10,1:2:s))) [0,0,0]
((),[10,1,2,0,0,0])
</pre>

<p>
The lambda here takes a state and puts <span class="fixed">2</span> and
<span class="fixed">1</span> onto the stack and presents <span
class="fixed">push 10</span> as its result. So when this whole thing is
flattened with <span class="fixed">join</span> and then run, it first puts
<span class="fixed">2</span> and <span class="fixed">1</span> onto the stack and
then <span class="fixed">push 10</span> gets carried out, pushing a <span
class="fixed">10</span> onto the top.
</p>

<p>
The implementation for <span class="fixed">join</span> is as follows:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
join :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a
join mm = do
    m &lt;- mm
    m
</pre>

<p>
Because the result of <span class="fixed">mm</span> is a monadic value, we
get that result and then just put it on a line of its own because it's a monadic
value. The trick here is that when we do <span class="fixed">m &lt;- mm</span>,
the context of the monad in which we
are in gets taken care of. That's why, for instance, <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> values result in <span class="fixed">Just</span>
values only if the outer and inner values are both <span class="fixed">Just</span> values. Here's what this would look like if the <span class="fixed">mm</span> value was set in advance to <span class="fixed">Just (Just 8)</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
joinedMaybes :: Maybe Int
joinedMaybes = do
    m &lt;- Just (Just 8)
    m
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/tipi.png" alt="im a cop too as well also" class="right" width="253"
height="379">

<p>
Perhaps the most interesting thing about <span class="fixed">join</span> is
that for every monad, feeding a monadic value to a function with <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is the same thing as just mapping that function
over the value and then using <span class="fixed">join</span> to flatten the
resulting nested monadic value! In other words, <span class="fixed">m &gt;&gt;=
f</span> is always the same thing as <span class="fixed">join (fmap f m)</span>!
It makes sense when you think about it. With <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, we're always thinking about
how to feed a monadic value to a function that takes a normal value but returns
a monadic value. If we just map that function over the monadic value, we have a
monadic value inside a monadic value. For instance, say we have <span
class="fixed">Just 9</span> and the function <span class="fixed">\x -&gt; Just
(x+1)</span>. If we map this function over <span class="fixed">Just 9</span>,
we're left with <span class="fixed">Just (Just 10)</span>.
</p>

<p>
The fact that <span class="fixed">m &gt;&gt;= f</span> always equals
<span class="fixed">join (fmap f m)</span> is very useful if we're making our
own <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance for some type because it's often
easier to figure out how we would flatten a nested monadic value than figuring
out how to implement <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>.
</p>

<h3>filterM</h3>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">filter</span> function is pretty much the bread of
Haskell programming (<span class="fixed">map</span> being the butter). It takes
a predicate and a list to filter out and then returns a new list where only the
elements that satisfy the predicate are kept. Its type is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
</pre>

<p>
The predicate takes an element of the list and returns a <span
class="fixed">Bool</span> value. Now, what if the <span class="fixed">Bool</span> value that it returned
was actually a monadic value? Whoa! That is, what if it came with a context?
Could that work? For instance, what if every <span
class="fixed">True</span> or a <span class="fixed">False</span> value that the
predicate produced also had an accompanying monoid value, like <span
class="fixed">["Accepted the number 5"]</span> or <span class="fixed">["3 is too
small"]</span>? That sounds like it could work. If that were the case, we'd
expect the resulting list to also come with a log of all the log values that
were produced along the way. So if the <span class="fixed">Bool</span> that the
predicate returned came with a context, we'd expect the final resulting list to have
some context attached as well, otherwise the context that each <span
class="fixed">Bool</span> came with would be lost.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">filterM</span> function from <span class="fixed">Control.Monad</span>
does just what we want! Its type is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
filterM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; m Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m [a]
</pre>

<p>
The predicate returns a monadic value whose result is a <span
class="fixed">Bool</span>, but because it's a monadic value, its context can be
anything from a possible failure to non-determinism and more! To ensure that the
context is reflected in the final result, the result is also a monadic value.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a list and only keep those values that are smaller than 4. To
start, we'll just use the regular <span class="fixed">filter</span> function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; filter (\x -&gt; x &lt; 4) [9,1,5,2,10,3]
[1,2,3]
</pre>

<p>
That's pretty easy. Now, let's make a predicate that, aside from presenting a
<span class="fixed">True</span> or <span class="fixed">False</span> result, also
provides a log of what it did. Of course, we'll be using the <span
class="fixed">Writer</span> monad for this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
keepSmall :: Int -&gt; Writer [String] Bool
keepSmall x
    | x &lt; 4 = do
        tell ["Keeping " ++ show x]
        return True
    | otherwise = do
        tell [show x ++ " is too large, throwing it away"]
        return False
</pre>

<p>
Instead of just and returning a <span class="fixed">Bool</span>, this function
returns a <span class="fixed">Writer [String] Bool</span>. It's a monadic
predicate. Sounds fancy, doesn't it? If the number is smaller than <span
class="fixed">4</span> we report that we're keeping it and then <span
class="fixed">return True</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's give it to <span class="fixed">filterM</span> along with a list.
Because the predicate returns a
<span class="fixed">Writer</span> value, the resulting list will also
be a <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fst $ runWriter $ filterM keepSmall [9,1,5,2,10,3]
[1,2,3]
</pre>

<p>
Examining the result of the resulting <span class="fixed">Writer</span> value,
we see that everything is in order. Now, let's print the log and see what we
got:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; mapM_ putStrLn $ snd $ runWriter $ filterM keepSmall [9,1,5,2,10,3]
9 is too large, throwing it away
Keeping 1
5 is too large, throwing it away
Keeping 2
10 is too large, throwing it away
Keeping 3
</pre>

<p>
Awesome. So just by providing a monadic predicate to <span class="fixed">filterM</span>,
we were able to filter a list while taking advantage of the monadic context that
we used.
</p>

<p>
A very cool Haskell trick is using <span class="fixed">filterM</span> to get the
powerset of a list (if we think of them as sets for now). The powerset of some
set is a set of all subsets of that set. So if we have a set like <span
class="fixed">[1,2,3]</span>, its powerset would include the following sets:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
[1,2,3]
[1,2]
[1,3]
[1]
[2,3]
[2]
[3]
[]
</pre>

<p>
In other words, getting a powerset is like getting all the combinations of
keeping and throwing out elements from a set. <span class="fixed">[2,3]</span>
is like the original set, only we excluded the number <span
class="fixed">1</span>.
</p>

<p>
To make a function that returns a powerset of some list, we're going to rely on
non-determinism. We take the list <span class="fixed">[1,2,3]</span> and then
look at the first element, which is <span class="fixed">1</span> and we ask
ourselves: should we keep it or drop it? Well, we'd like to do both actually. So
we are going to filter a list and we'll use a predicate that non-deterministically
both keeps and drops every element from the list. Here's our <span
class="fixed">powerset</span> function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
powerset :: [a] -&gt; [[a]]
powerset xs = filterM (\x -&gt; [True, False]) xs
</pre>

<p>
Wait, that's it? Yup. We choose to drop and keep every element, regardless of
what that element is. We have a non-deterministic predicate, so the resulting
list will also be a non-deterministic value and will thus be a list of lists. Let's
give this a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; powerset [1,2,3]
[[1,2,3],[1,2],[1,3],[1],[2,3],[2],[3],[]]
</pre>

<p>
This takes a bit of thinking to wrap your head around, but if you just consider
lists as non-deterministic values that don't know what to be so they just decide
to be everything at once, it's a bit easier.
</p>

<h3>foldM</h3>

<p>
The monadic counterpart to <span class="fixed">foldl</span> is <span
class="fixed">foldM</span>. If you remember your folds from the <a href="../higher-order-functions.html#folds">folds section</a>, you know that <span class="fixed">foldl</span> takes a binary
function, a starting accumulator and a list to fold up and then folds it from the left
into a single value by using the binary function. <span class="fixed">foldM</span> does the same
thing, except it takes a binary function that produces a monadic value and folds
the list up with that. Unsurprisingly, the resulting value is also monadic. The
type of <span class="fixed">foldl</span> is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foldl :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; a
</pre>

<p>
Whereas <span class="fixed">foldM</span> has the following type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foldM :: (Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; b -&gt; m a) -&gt; a -&gt; [b] -&gt; m a
</pre>

<p>
The value that the binary function returns is monadic and so the result of the
whole fold is monadic as well. Let's sum a list of numbers with a
fold:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; foldl (\acc x -&gt; acc + x) 0 [2,8,3,1]
14
</pre>

<p>
The starting accumulator is <span class="fixed">0</span> and then <span
class="fixed">2</span> gets added to the accumulator, resulting in a new
accumulator that has a value of <span class="fixed">2</span>. <span
class="fixed">8</span> gets added to this accumulator resulting in an
accumulator of <span class="fixed">10</span> and so on and when we reach the
end, the final accumulator is the result.
</p>

<p>
Now what if we wanted to sum a list of numbers but with the added condition that
if any number is greater than <span class="fixed">9</span> in the list, the
whole thing fails? It would make sense to use a binary function that checks if
the current number is greater than <span class="fixed">9</span> and if it is,
fails, and if it isn't, continues on its merry way. Because of this added
possibility of failure, let's make our binary function return a <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> accumulator instead of a normal one. Here's the
binary function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
binSmalls :: Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Maybe Int
binSmalls acc x
    | x &gt; 9     = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (acc + x)
</pre>

<p>
Because our binary function is now a monadic function, we can't use it with the
normal <span class="fixed">foldl</span>, but we have to use <span
class="fixed">foldM</span>. Here goes:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; foldM binSmalls 0 [2,8,3,1]
Just 14
ghci&gt; foldM binSmalls 0 [2,11,3,1]
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Excellent! Because one number in the list was greater than <span
class="fixed">9</span>, the whole thing resulted in a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. Folding with a binary function that returns a
<span class="fixed">Writer</span> value is cool as well because then you log
whatever you want as your fold goes along its way.
</p>

<h3>Making a safe RPN calculator</h3>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/miner.png" alt="i've found yellow!" class="left" width="280"
height="396">

<p>
When we were solving the problem of <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/reverse-polish-notation-calculator">implementing an RPN calculator</a>,
we noted that it worked fine as long as the input that it got made sense.
But if something went wrong, it caused our whole program to crash. Now that we
know how to take some code that we have and make it monadic, let's take our RPN
calculator and add error handling to it by taking advantage of the
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad.
</p>

<p>
We implemented our RPN calculator by taking a string like <span
class="fixed">"1 3 + 2 *"</span>, breaking it up into words to get something
like <span class="fixed">["1","3","+","2","*"]</span> and then folding over that
list by starting out with an empty stack and then using a binary folding
function that adds numbers to the stack or manipulates numbers on the top of the
stack to add them together and divide them and such.
</p>

<p>
This was the main body of our function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List

solveRPN :: String -&gt; Double
solveRPN = head . foldl foldingFunction [] . words
</pre>

<p>
We made the expression into a list of strings, folded over it with our folding
function and then when we were left with just one item in the stack, we returned
that item as the answer. This was the folding function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foldingFunction :: [Double] -&gt; String -&gt; [Double]
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "*" = (x * y):ys
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "+" = (x + y):ys
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "-" = (y - x):ys
foldingFunction xs numberString = read numberString:xs
</pre>

<p>
The accumulator of the fold was a stack, which we represented with a list of
<span class="fixed">Double</span> values. As the folding function went over the RPN expression, if
the current item was an operator, it took two items off the top of the stack,
applied the operator between them and then put the result back on the stack. If
the current item was a string that represented a number, it converted that
string into an actual number and returned a new stack that was like the old one,
except with that number pushed to the top.
</p>

<p>
Let's first make our folding function capable of graceful failure. Its type is
going to change from what it is now to this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foldingFunction :: [Double] -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe [Double]
</pre>

<p>
So it will either return <span class="fixed">Just</span> a new stack or it will
fail with <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>
<p>The <span class="fixed">reads</span> function is like
<span class="fixed">read</span>, only it returns a list with a single element in
case of a successful read. If it fails to read something, then it returns an
empty list. Apart from returning the value that it read, it also returns the
part of the string that it didn't consume. We're going to say that it always has
to consume the full input to work and make it into a <span class="fixed">readMaybe</span> function
for convenience. Here it is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
readMaybe :: (Read a) =&gt; String -&gt; Maybe a
readMaybe st = case reads st of [(x,"")] -&gt; Just x
                                _ -&gt; Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Testing it out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; readMaybe "1" :: Maybe Int
Just 1
ghci&gt; readMaybe "GO TO HELL" :: Maybe Int
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Okay, it seems to work. So, let's make our folding function into a monadic
function that can fail:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foldingFunction :: [Double] -&gt; String -&gt; Maybe [Double]
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "*" = return ((x * y):ys)
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "+" = return ((x + y):ys)
foldingFunction (x:y:ys) "-" = return ((y - x):ys)
foldingFunction xs numberString = liftM (:xs) (readMaybe numberString)
</pre>

<p>
The first three cases are like the old ones, except the new stack gets
wrapped in a <span class="fixed">Just</span> (we used <span
class="fixed">return</span> here to do this, but we could have written
<span class="fixed">Just</span> just as well). In the last case, we do
<span class="fixed">readMaybe numberString</span> and then we map <span
class="fixed">(:xs)</span> over it. So if the stack <span class="fixed">xs</span>
is <span class="fixed">[1.0,2.0]</span> and <span class="fixed">readMaybe
numberString</span> results in a <span class="fixed">Just 3.0</span>, the result
is <span class="fixed">Just [3.0,1.0,2.0]</span>. If <span class="fixed">readMaybe numberString</span> results in a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span> then the result is <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
Let's try out the folding function by itself:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [3,2] "*"
Just [6.0]
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [3,2] "-"
Just [-1.0]
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [] "*"
Nothing
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [] "1"
Just [1.0]
ghci&gt; foldingFunction [] "1 wawawawa"
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
It looks like it's working! And now it's time for the new and improved
<span class="fixed">solveRPN</span>. Here it is ladies and gents!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List

solveRPN :: String -&gt; Maybe Double
solveRPN st = do
    [result] &lt;- foldM foldingFunction [] (words st)
    return result
</pre>

<p>
Just like before, we take the string and make it into a list of words. Then,
we do a fold, starting with the empty stack, only instead of doing a normal
<span class="fixed">foldl</span>, we do a <span class="fixed">foldM</span>. The
result of that <span class="fixed">foldM</span> should be a <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value that contains a list (that's our final stack)
and that list should have only one value. We use a <span class="fixed">do</span>
expression to get that value and we call it <span class="fixed">result</span>. In
case the <span class="fixed">foldM</span> returns a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the whole thing
will be a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, because that's how <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> works. Also notice that we pattern match in the
<span class="fixed">do</span> expression, so if the list has more than one value
or none at all, the pattern match fails and a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>
is produced. In the last line we just do <span class="fixed">return result</span> to present
the result of the RPN calculation as the result of the final <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value.
</p>

<p>
Let's give it a shot:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; solveRPN "1 2 * 4 +"
Just 6.0
ghci&gt; solveRPN "1 2 * 4 + 5 *"
Just 30.0
ghci&gt; solveRPN "1 2 * 4"
Nothing
ghci&gt; solveRPN "1 8 wharglbllargh"
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
The first failure happens because the final stack isn't a list with one element
in it and so the pattern matching in the <span class="fixed">do</span>
expression fails. The second failure happens because <span class="fixed">readMaybe</span>
returns a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>

<h3>Composing monadic functions</h3>

<p>
When we were learning about the monad laws, we said that the
<span class="fixed">&lt;=&lt;</span> function is just like composition, only
instead of working for normal functions like <span class="fixed">a -&gt; b</span>, it
works for monadic functions like <span class="fixed">a -&gt; m b</span>. For
instance:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let f = (+1) . (*100)
ghci&gt; f 4
401
ghci&gt; let g = (\x -&gt; return (x+1)) &lt;=&lt; (\x -&gt; return (x*100))
ghci&gt; Just 4 &gt;&gt;= g
Just 401
</pre>


<p>
In this example we first composed two normal functions, applied the
resulting function to <span class="fixed">4</span> and then we composed two
monadic functions and fed <span class="fixed">Just 4</span> to the resulting
function with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>.
</p>

<p>
If we have a bunch of functions in a list, we can compose them one all into one
big function by just using <span class="fixed">id</span> as the starting
accumulator and the <span class="fixed">.</span> function as the binary
function. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let f = foldr (.) id [(+1),(*100),(+1)]
ghci&gt; f 1
201
</pre>

<p>
The function <span class="fixed">f</span> takes a number and then adds
<span class="fixed">1</span> to it, multiplies the result by
<span class="fixed">100</span> and then adds <span class="fixed">1</span> to
that. Anyway, we can compose monadic functions in the same way, only instead
normal composition we use <span class="fixed">&lt;=&lt;</span> and instead of
<span class="fixed">id</span> we use <span class="fixed">return</span>. We don't
have to use a <span class="fixed">foldM</span> over a <span
class="fixed">foldr</span> or anything because the <span class="fixed">&lt;=&lt;</span>
function makes sure that composition happens in a monadic fashion.
</p>

<p>
When we were getting to know the list monad in the <a href="a-fistful-of-monads.html#the-list-monad">previous chapter</a>, we used
it to figure out if a knight can go from one position on a
chessboard to another in exactly three moves. We had a function
called <span class="fixed">moveKnight</span> which took the knight's position on
the board and returned all the possible moves that he can make next. Then, to
generate all the possible positions that he can have after taking three moves,
we made the following function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
in3 start = return start &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight
</pre>

<p>
And to check if he can go from <span class="fixed">start</span> to
<span class="fixed">end</span> in three moves, we did the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
canReachIn3 :: KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn3 start end = end `elem` in3 start
</pre>

<p>
Using monadic function composition, we can make a function like <span
class="fixed">in3</span>, only instead of generating all the positions that the
knight can have after making three moves, we can do it for an arbitrary number
of moves. If you look at <span class="fixed">in3</span>, we see that we
used <span class="fixed">moveKnight</span> three times and each time we used
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed it all the possible previous
positions. So now, let's make it more general. Here's how to do it:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List

inMany :: Int -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
inMany x start = return start &gt;&gt;= foldr (&lt;=&lt;) return (replicate x moveKnight)
</pre>

<p>
First we use <span class="fixed">replicate</span> to make a list that contains
<span class="fixed">x</span> copies of the function <span class="fixed">moveKnight</span>. Then,
we monadically compose all those functions into one, which gives us a function
that takes a starting position and non-deterministically moves the knight
<span class="fixed">x</span> times. Then, we just make the starting position
into a singleton list with <span class="fixed">return</span> and feed it to the
function.
</p>

<p>
Now, we can change our <span class="fixed">canReachIn3</span> function to be
more general as well:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
canReachIn :: Int -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn x start end = end `elem` inMany x start
</pre>

<h2>Making monads</h2>
<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/spearhead.png" alt="kewl" class="center" width="780" height="244">

<p>
In this section, we're going to look at an example of how a type gets made,
identified as a monad and then given the appropriate
<span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance. We don't usually set out to make
a monad with the sole purpose of making a monad. Instead, we usually make a type
that whose purpose is to model an aspect of some problem and then later on if we
see that the type represents a value with a context and can act like a monad, we
give it a <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance.
</p>

<p>
As we've seen, lists are used to represent non-deterministic values. A list like
<span class="fixed">[3,5,9]</span> can be viewed as a single non-deterministic
value that just can't decide what it's going to be. When we feed a list into
a function with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, it just makes all the
possible choices of taking an element from the list and applying the function to it
and then presents those results in a list as well.
</p>

<p>
If we look at the list <span class="fixed">[3,5,9]</span> as the numbers
<span class="fixed">3</span>, <span class="fixed">5</span> and
<span class="fixed">9</span> occurring at once, we might notice that there's no
info regarding the probability that each of those numbers occurs. What if we
wanted to model a non-deterministic value like <span class="fixed">[3,5,9]</span>,
but we wanted to express that <span class="fixed">3</span> has a 50% chance of
happening and <span class="fixed">5</span> and <span class="fixed">9</span> both
have a 25% chance of happening? Let's try and make this happen!
</p>

<p>
Let's say that every item in the list comes with another value, a probability
of it happening. It might make sense to present this like this then:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
[(3,0.5),(5,0.25),(9,0.25)]
</pre>

<p>
In mathematics, probabilities aren't usually expressed in percentages, but
rather in real numbers between a 0 and 1. A 0 means that there's no chance in
hell for something to happen and a 1 means that it's happening for sure. Floating
point numbers can get real messy real fast because they tend to lose
precision, so Haskell offers us a data type for rational numbers that doesn't lose
precision. That type is called <span class="fixed">Rational</span> and it lives
in <span class="fixed">Data.Ratio</span>. To make a <span class="fixed">Rational</span>,
we write it as if it were a fraction. The numerator and the denominator are
separated by a <span class="fixed">%</span>. Here are a few examples:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; 1%4
1 % 4
ghci&gt; 1%2 + 1%2
1 % 1
ghci&gt; 1%3 + 5%4
19 % 12
</pre>

<p>
The first line is just one quarter. In the second line we add two halves to get
a whole and in the third line we add one third with five quarters and get
nineteen twelfths. So let's throw out our floating points and use
<span class="fixed">Rational</span> for our probabilities:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [(3,1%2),(5,1%4),(9,1%4)]
[(3,1 % 2),(5,1 % 4),(9,1 % 4)]
</pre>

<p>
Okay, so <span class="fixed">3</span> has a one out of two chance of happening while
<span class="fixed">5</span> and <span class="fixed">9</span> will happen one
time out of four. Pretty neat.
</p>

<p>
We took lists and we added some extra context to them, so this represents values
with contexts too. Before we go any further, let's wrap this into a
<span class="fixed">newtype</span> because something tells me we'll be making
some instances.
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.Ratio

newtype Prob a = Prob { getProb :: [(a,Rational)] } deriving Show
</pre>

<p>
Alright. Is this a functor? Well, the list is a functor, so this should probably
be a functor as well, because we just added some stuff to the list. When we map
a function over a list, we apply it to each element. Here, we'll apply it to
each element as well, only we'll leave the probabilities as they are. Let's make
an instance:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Functor Prob where
    fmap f (Prob xs) = Prob $ map (\(x,p) -&gt; (f x,p)) xs
</pre>

<p>
We unwrap it from the <span class="fixed">newtype</span> with pattern matching,
apply the function <span class="fixed">f</span> to the values while keeping the
probabilities as they are and then wrap it back up. Let's see if it works:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fmap negate (Prob [(3,1%2),(5,1%4),(9,1%4)])
Prob {getProb = [(-3,1 % 2),(-5,1 % 4),(-9,1 % 4)]}
</pre>

<p>
Another thing to note is that the probabilities should always add up to
<span class="fixed">1</span>. If those are all the things that can happen, it
doesn't make sense for the sum of their probabilities to be anything other than
<span class="fixed">1</span>. A coin that lands tails 75% of the time and
heads 50% of the time seems like it could only work in some other strange
universe.
</p>

<p>
Now the big question, is this a monad? Given how the list is a monad, this
looks like it should be a monad as well. First, let's think about
<span class="fixed">return</span>. How does it work for lists? It takes a value
and puts it in a singleton list. What about here? Well, since it's supposed to
be a default minimal context, it should also make a singleton list. What about
the probability? Well, <span class="fixed">return x</span> is supposed to make a
monadic value that always presents <span class="fixed">x</span> as its result,
so it doesn't make sense for the probability to be <span class="fixed">0</span>.
If it always has to present it as its result, the probability should be
<span class="fixed">1</span>!
</p>

<p>
What about <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>? Seems kind of tricky, so let's
make use of the fact that <span class="fixed">m &gt;&gt;= f</span> always equals
<span class="fixed">join (fmap f m)</span> for monads and think about how we
would flatten a probability list of probability lists. As an example, let's
consider this list where there's a 25% chance that exactly one of
<span class="fixed">'a'</span> or <span class="fixed">'b'</span> will happen. Both
<span class="fixed">'a'</span> and <span class="fixed">'b'</span> are equally
likely to occur. Also, there's a 75% chance that
exactly one of <span class="fixed">'c'</span> or <span class="fixed">'d'</span>
will happen. <span class="fixed">'c'</span> and <span class="fixed">'d'</span>
are also equally likely to happen. Here's a picture of a probability list that
models this scenario:
</p>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/prob.png" alt="probs" class="left" width="456" height="142">

<p>
What are the chances for each of these letters to occur? If we were to draw this
as just four boxes, each with a probability, what would those probabilities be?
To find out, all we have to do is multiply each probability with all of
probabilities that it contains. <span class="fixed">'a'</span> would occur one
time out of eight, as would <span class="fixed">'b'</span>, because if we
multiply one half by one quarter we get one eighth. <span
class="fixed">'c'</span> would happen three times out of eight because
three quarters multiplied by one half is three eighths. <span
class="fixed">'d'</span> would also happen three times out of eight. If we sum
all the probabilities, they still add up to one.
</p>

<p>
Here's this situation expressed as a probability list:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
thisSituation :: Prob (Prob Char)
thisSituation = Prob
    [( Prob [('a',1%2),('b',1%2)] , 1%4 )
    ,( Prob [('c',1%2),('d',1%2)] , 3%4)
    ]
</pre>

<p>
Notice that its type is <span class="fixed">Prob (Prob Char)</span>. So now that
we've figure out how to flatten a nested probability list, all we have to do is
write the code for this and then we can write <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> simply as
<span class="fixed">join (fmap f m)</span> and we have ourselves a monad! So
here's <span class="fixed">flatten</span>, which we'll use because the name <span class="fixed">join</span>
is already taken:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
flatten :: Prob (Prob a) -&gt; Prob a
flatten (Prob xs) = Prob $ concat $ map multAll xs
    where multAll (Prob innerxs,p) = map (\(x,r) -&gt; (x,p*r)) innerxs
</pre>

<p>
The function <span class="fixed">multAll</span> takes a tuple of probability
list and a probability <span class="fixed">p</span> that comes with it and then
multiplies every inner probability with <span class="fixed">p</span>, returning
a list of pairs of items and probabilities. We map <span class="fixed">multAll</span> over
each pair in our nested probability list and then we just flatten the resulting
nested list.
</p>

<p>
Now we have all that we need, we can write a <span class="fixed">Monad</span>
instance!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad Prob where
    return x = Prob [(x,1%1)]
    m &gt;&gt;= f = flatten (fmap f m)
    fail _ = Prob []
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/for-a-few-monads-more/ride.png" alt="ride em cowboy" class="right" width="177" height="406">

<p>
Because we already did all the hard work, the instance is very simple. We also
defined the <span class="fixed">fail</span> function, which is the same as it is
for lists, so if there's a pattern match failure in a <span class="fixed">do</span>
expression, a failure occurs within the context of a probability list.
</p>

<p>
It's also important to check if the monad laws hold for the monad that we just
made. The first one says that <span class="fixed">return x &gt;&gt;= f</span>
should be equal to <span class="fixed">f x</span>. A rigorous proof would be
rather tedious, but we can see that if we put a value in a default context
with <span class="fixed">return</span> and then <span class="fixed">fmap</span>
a function over that and flatten the resulting probability list, every
probability that results from the function would be multiplied by the <span
class="fixed">1%1</span> probability that we made with <span
class="fixed">return</span>, so it wouldn't affect the context. The reasoning
for <span class="fixed">m &gt;&gt;= return</span> being equal to just
<span class="fixed">m</span> is similar. The third law states that
<span class="fixed">f &lt;=&lt; (g &lt;=&lt; h)</span> should be the same as
<span class="fixed">(f &lt;=&lt; g) &lt;=&lt; h</span>. This one holds as well,
because it holds for the list monad which forms the basis of the probability
monad and because multiplication is associative. <span class="fixed">1%2 * (1%3
* 1%5)</span> is equal to <span class="fixed">(1%2 * 1%3) * 1%5</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now that we have a monad, what can we do with it? Well, it can help us do
calculations with probabilities. We can treat probabilistic events as values
with contexts and the probability monad will make sure that those probabilities
get reflected in the probabilities of the final result.
</p>

<p>
Say we have two normal coins and one loaded coin that gets tails an astounding
nine times out of ten and heads only one time out of ten. If we throw all the
coins at once, what are the odds of all of them landing tails? First, let's make
probability values for a normal coin flip and for a loaded one:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Coin = Heads | Tails deriving (Show, Eq)

coin :: Prob Coin
coin = Prob [(Heads,1%2),(Tails,1%2)]

loadedCoin :: Prob Coin
loadedCoin = Prob [(Heads,1%10),(Tails,9%10)]
</pre>

<p>
And finally, the coin throwing action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List (all)

flipThree :: Prob Bool
flipThree = do
    a &lt;- coin
    b &lt;- coin
    c &lt;- loadedCoin
    return (all (==Tails) [a,b,c])
</pre>

<p>
Giving it a go, we see that the odds of all three landing tails are not that
good, despite cheating with our loaded coin:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; getProb flipThree
[(False,1 % 40),(False,9 % 40),(False,1 % 40),(False,9 % 40),
 (False,1 % 40),(False,9 % 40),(False,1 % 40),(True,9 % 40)]
</pre>

<p>
All three of them will land tails nine times out of forty, which is less than
25%. We see that our monad doesn't know how to join all of the
<span class="fixed">False</span> outcomes where all coins don't land tails into
one outcome. That's not a big problem, since writing a function to put all the
same outcomes into one outcome is pretty easy and is left as an exercise to the
reader (you!)
</p>

<p>
In this section, we went from having a question (what if lists also carried
information about probability?) to making a type, recognizing a monad and
finally making an instance and doing something with it. I think that's quite
fetching! By now, we should have a pretty good grasp on monads and what they're
about.
