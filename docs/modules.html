        <h1>Modules</h1>
<a name="loading-modules"></a><h2>Loading modules</h2>
<img src="assets/images/modules/modules.png" alt="modules" class="right" width="230" height="162">
<p>A Haskell module is a collection of related functions, types and typeclasses. A Haskell program is a collection of modules where the main module loads up the other modules and then uses the functions defined in them to do something. Having code split up into several modules has quite a lot of advantages. If a module is generic enough, the functions it exports can be used in a multitude of different programs. If your own code is separated into self-contained modules which don't rely on each other too much (we also say they are loosely coupled), you can reuse them later on. It makes the whole deal of writing code more manageable by having it split into several parts, each of which has some sort of purpose.</p>
<p>The Haskell standard library is split into modules, each of them contains functions and types that are somehow related and serve some common purpose. There's a module for manipulating lists, a module for concurrent programming, a module for dealing with complex numbers, etc. All the functions, types and typeclasses that we've dealt with so far were part of the <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> module, which is imported by default. In this chapter, we're going to examine a few useful modules and the functions that they have. But first, we're going to see how to import modules.</p>
<p>The syntax for importing modules in a Haskell script is <span class="fixed">import &lt;module name&gt;</span>. This must be done before defining any functions, so imports are usually done at the top of the file. One script can, of course, import several modules. Just put each import statement into a separate line. Let's import the <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> module, which has a bunch of useful functions for working with lists and use a function that it exports to create a function that tells us how many unique elements a list has.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List

numUniques :: (Eq a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; Int
numUniques = length . nub
</pre>
<p>When you do <span class="fixed">import Data.List</span>, all the functions that <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> exports become available in the global namespace, meaning that you can call them from wherever in the script. <span class="fixed">nub</span> is a function defined in <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> that takes a list and weeds out duplicate elements. Composing <span class="fixed">length</span> and <span class="fixed">nub</span> by doing <span class="fixed">length . nub</span> produces a function that's the equivalent of <span class="fixed">\xs -&gt; length (nub xs)</span>.</p>
<p>You can also put the functions of modules into the global namespace when using GHCI. If you're in GHCI and you want to be able to call the functions exported by <span class="fixed">Data.List</span>, do this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; :m + Data.List
</pre>
<p>If we want to load up the names from several modules inside GHCI, we don't have to do <span class="fixed">:m +</span> several times, we can just load up several modules at once.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; :m + Data.List Data.Map Data.Set
</pre>
<p>However, if you've loaded a script that already imports a module, you don't need to use <span class="fixed">:m +</span> to get access to it.</p>
<p>If you just need a couple of functions from a module, you can selectively import just those functions. If we wanted to import only the <span class="fixed">nub</span> and <span class="fixed">sort</span> functions from <span class="fixed">Data.List</span>, we'd do this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List (nub, sort)
</pre>
<p>You can also choose to import all of the functions of a module except a few select ones. That's often useful when several modules export functions with the same name and you want to get rid of the offending ones. Say we already have our own function that's called <span class="fixed">nub</span> and we want to import all the functions from <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> except the <span class="fixed">nub</span> function:
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List hiding (nub)
</pre>
<p>Another way of dealing with name clashes is to do qualified imports. The <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> module, which offers a data structure for looking up values by key, exports a bunch of functions with the same name as <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> functions, like <span class="fixed">filter</span> or <span class="fixed">null</span>. So when we import <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> and then call <span class="fixed">filter</span>, Haskell won't know which function to use. Here's how we solve this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import qualified Data.Map
</pre>
<p>This makes it so that if we want to reference <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span>'s <span class="fixed">filter</span> function, we have to do <span class="fixed">Data.Map.filter</span>, whereas just <span class="fixed">filter</span> still refers to the normal <span class="fixed">filter</span> we all know and love. But typing out <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> in front of every function from that module is kind of tedious. That's why we can rename the qualified import to something shorter:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import qualified Data.Map as M
</pre>
<p>Now, to reference <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span>'s <span class="fixed">filter</span> function, we just use <span class="fixed">M.filter</span>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/">this handy reference</a> to see which modules are in the standard library. A great way to pick up new Haskell knowledge is to just click through the standard library reference and explore the modules and their functions. You can also view the Haskell source code for each module. Reading the source code of some modules is a really good way to learn Haskell and get a solid feel for it.</p>
<p>To search for functions or to find out where they're located, use <a href="https://hoogle.haskell.org/">Hoogle</a>. It's a really awesome Haskell search engine, you can search by name, module name or even type signature.</p>
<a name="data-list"></a><h2>Data.List</h2>
<p>The <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> module is all about lists, obviously. It provides some very useful functions for dealing with them. We've already met some of its functions (like <span class="fixed">map</span> and <span class="fixed">filter</span>) because the <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> module exports some functions from <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> for convenience. You don't have to import <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> via a qualified import because it doesn't clash with any <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> names except for those that <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> already steals from <span class="fixed">Data.List</span>. Let's take a look at some of the functions that we haven't met before.</p>
<p><span class="label function">intersperse</span> takes an element and a list and then puts that element in between each pair of elements in the list. Here's a demonstration:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; intersperse '.' "MONKEY"
"M.O.N.K.E.Y"
ghci&gt; intersperse 0 [1,2,3,4,5,6]
[1,0,2,0,3,0,4,0,5,0,6]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">intercalate</span> takes a list of lists and a list. It then inserts that list in between all those lists and then flattens the result.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; intercalate " " ["hey","there","guys"]
"hey there guys"
ghci&gt; intercalate [0,0,0] [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[1,2,3,0,0,0,4,5,6,0,0,0,7,8,9]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">transpose</span> transposes a list of lists. If you look at a list of lists as a 2D matrix, the columns become the rows and vice versa.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; transpose [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
[[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
ghci&gt; transpose ["hey","there","guys"]
["htg","ehu","yey","rs","e"]
</pre>
<p>Say we have the polynomials <i>3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 9</i>, <i>10x<sup>3</sup> + 9</i> and <i>8x<sup>3</sup> + 5x<sup>2</sup> + x - 1</i> and we want to add them together. We can use the lists <span class="fixed">[0,3,5,9]</span>, <span class="fixed">[10,0,0,9]</span> and <span class="fixed">[8,5,1,-1]</span> to represent them in Haskell. Now, to add them, all we have to do is this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; map sum $ transpose [[0,3,5,9],[10,0,0,9],[8,5,1,-1]]
[18,8,6,17]
</pre>
<p>When we transpose these three lists, the third powers are then in the first row, the second powers in the second one and so on. Mapping <span class="fixed">sum</span> to that produces our desired result.</p>
<img src="assets/images/modules/legolists.png" alt="shopping lists" class="left" width="230" height="212">
<p><span class="label function">foldl'</span> and <span class="label function">foldl1'</span> are stricter versions of their respective lazy incarnations. When using lazy folds on really big lists, you might often get a stack overflow error. The culprit for that is that due to the lazy nature of the folds, the accumulator value isn't actually updated as the folding happens. What actually happens is that the accumulator kind of makes a promise that it will compute its value when asked to actually produce the result (also called a thunk). That happens for every intermediate accumulator and all those thunks overflow your stack. The strict folds aren't lazy buggers and actually compute the intermediate values as they go along instead of filling up your stack with thunks. So if you ever get stack overflow errors when doing lazy folds, try switching to their strict versions.</p>
<p><span class="label function">concat</span> flattens a list of lists into just a list of elements.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; concat ["foo","bar","car"]
"foobarcar"
ghci&gt; concat [[3,4,5],[2,3,4],[2,1,1]]
[3,4,5,2,3,4,2,1,1]
</pre>
<p>It will just remove one level of nesting. So if you want to completely flatten <span class="fixed">[[[2,3],[3,4,5],[2]],[[2,3],[3,4]]]</span>, which is a list of lists of lists, you have to concatenate it twice.</p>
<p>Doing <span class="label function">concatMap</span> is the same as first mapping a function to a list and then concatenating the list with <span class="fixed">concat</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; concatMap (replicate 4) [1..3]
[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">and</span> takes a list of boolean values and returns <span class="fixed">True</span> only if all the values in the list are <span class="fixed">True</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; and $ map (&gt;4) [5,6,7,8]
True
ghci&gt; and $ map (==4) [4,4,4,3,4]
False
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">or</span> is like <span class="fixed">and</span>, only it returns <span class="fixed">True</span> if any of the boolean values in a list is <span class="fixed">True</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; or $ map (==4) [2,3,4,5,6,1]
True
ghci&gt; or $ map (&gt;4) [1,2,3]
False
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">any</span> and <span class="label function">all</span> take a predicate and then check if any or all the elements in a list satisfy the predicate, respectively. Usually we use these two functions instead of mapping over a list and then doing <span class="fixed">and</span> or <span class="fixed">or</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; any (==4) [2,3,5,6,1,4]
True
ghci&gt; all (&gt;4) [6,9,10]
True
ghci&gt; all (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "HEYGUYSwhatsup"
False
ghci&gt; any (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "HEYGUYSwhatsup"
True
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">iterate</span> takes a function and a starting value. It applies the function to the starting value, then it applies that function to the result, then it applies the function to that result again, etc. It returns all the results in the form of an infinite list.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; take 10 $ iterate (*2) 1
[1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512]
ghci&gt; take 3 $ iterate (++ "haha") "haha"
["haha","hahahaha","hahahahahaha"]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">splitAt</span> takes a number and a list. It then splits the list at that many elements, returning the resulting two lists in a tuple.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; splitAt 3 "heyman"
("hey","man")
ghci&gt; splitAt 100 "heyman"
("heyman","")
ghci&gt; splitAt (-3) "heyman"
("","heyman")
ghci&gt; let (a,b) = splitAt 3 "foobar" in b ++ a
"barfoo"
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">takeWhile</span> is a really useful little function. It takes elements from a list while the predicate holds and then when an element is encountered that doesn't satisfy the predicate, it's cut off. It turns out this is very useful.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; takeWhile (&gt;3) [6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]
[6,5,4]
ghci&gt; takeWhile (/=' ') "This is a sentence"
"This"
</pre>
<p>Say we wanted to know the sum of all third powers that are under 10,000. We can't map <span class="fixed">(^3)</span> to <span class="fixed">[1..]</span>, apply a filter and then try to sum that up because filtering an infinite list never finishes. You may know that all the elements here are ascending but Haskell doesn't. That's why we can do this:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; sum $ takeWhile (<10000) $ map (^3) [1..]
53361
</pre>
<p>We apply <span class="fixed">(^3)</span> to an infinite list and then once an element that's over 10,000 is encountered, the list is cut off. Now we can sum it up easily.</p>
<p><span class="label function">dropWhile</span> is similar, only it drops all the elements while the predicate is true. Once predicate equates to <span class="fixed">False</span>, it returns the rest of the list. An extremely useful and lovely function!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; dropWhile (/=' ') "This is a sentence"
" is a sentence"
ghci&gt; dropWhile (<3) [1,2,2,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]
[3,4,5,4,3,2,1]
</pre>
<p>We're given a list that represents the value of a stock by date. The list is made of tuples whose first component is the stock value, the second is the year, the third is the month and the fourth is the date. We want to know when the stock value first exceeded one thousand dollars!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; let stock = [(994.4,2008,9,1),(995.2,2008,9,2),(999.2,2008,9,3),(1001.4,2008,9,4),(998.3,2008,9,5)]
ghci&gt; head (dropWhile (\(val,y,m,d) -&gt; val < 1000) stock)
(1001.4,2008,9,4)
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">span</span> is kind of like <span class="fixed">takeWhile</span>, only it returns a pair of lists. The first list contains everything the resulting list from <span class="fixed">takeWhile</span> would contain if it were called with the same predicate and the same list. The second list contains the part of the list that would have been dropped.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; let (fw, rest) = span (/=' ') "This is a sentence" in "First word:" ++ fw ++ ", the rest:" ++ rest
"First word: This, the rest: is a sentence"
</pre>
<p>Whereas <span class="fixed">span</span> spans the list while the predicate is true, <span class="label function">break</span> breaks it when the predicate is first true. Doing <span class="fixed">break p</span> is the equivalent of doing <span class="fixed">span (not . p)</span>.  </p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; break (==4) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
([1,2,3],[4,5,6,7])
ghci&gt; span (/=4) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
([1,2,3],[4,5,6,7])
</pre>
<p>When using <span class="fixed">break</span>, the second list in the result will start with the first element that satisfies the predicate.</p>
<p><span class="label function">sort</span> simply sorts a list. The type of the elements in the list has to be part of the <span class="fixed">Ord</span> typeclass, because if the elements of a list can't be put in some kind of order, then the list can't be sorted.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; sort [8,5,3,2,1,6,4,2]
[1,2,2,3,4,5,6,8]
ghci&gt; sort "This will be sorted soon"
"    Tbdeehiillnooorssstw"
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">group</span> takes a list and groups adjacent elements into sublists if they are equal.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; group [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,5,6,7]
[[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[3,3],[2,2,2],[5],[6],[7]]
</pre>
<p>If we sort a list before grouping it, we can find out how many times each element appears in the list.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; map (\l@(x:xs) -&gt; (x,length l)) . group . sort $ [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,2,2,2,5,6,7]
[(1,4),(2,7),(3,2),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1)]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">inits</span> and <span class="label function">tails</span> are like <span class="fixed">init</span> and <span class="fixed">tail</span>, only they recursively apply that to a list until there's nothing left. Observe.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; inits "w00t"
["","w","w0","w00","w00t"]
ghci&gt; tails "w00t"
["w00t","00t","0t","t",""]
ghci&gt; let w = "w00t" in zip (inits w) (tails w)
[("","w00t"),("w","00t"),("w0","0t"),("w00","t"),("w00t","")]
</pre>
<p>Let's use a fold to implement searching a list for a sublist.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
search :: (Eq a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool
search needle haystack =
    let nlen = length needle
    in  foldl (\acc x -&gt; if take nlen x == needle then True else acc) False (tails haystack)
</pre>
<p>First we call <span class="fixed">tails</span> with the list in which we're searching. Then we go over each tail and see if it starts with what we're looking for.</p>
<p>With that, we actually just made a function that behaves like <span class="label function">isInfixOf</span>. <span class="fixed">isInfixOf</span> searches for a sublist within a list and returns <span class="fixed">True</span> if the sublist we're looking for is somewhere inside the target list.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; "cat" `isInfixOf` "im a cat burglar"
True
ghci&gt; "Cat" `isInfixOf` "im a cat burglar"
False
ghci&gt; "cats" `isInfixOf` "im a cat burglar"
False
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">isPrefixOf</span> and <span class="label function">isSuffixOf</span> search for a sublist at the beginning and at the end of a list, respectively.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; "hey" `isPrefixOf` "hey there!"
True
ghci&gt; "hey" `isPrefixOf` "oh hey there!"
False
ghci&gt; "there!" `isSuffixOf` "oh hey there!"
True
ghci&gt; "there!" `isSuffixOf` "oh hey there"
False
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">elem</span> and <span class="label function">notElem</span> check if an element is or isn't inside a list. </p>
<p><span class="label function">partition</span> takes a list and a predicate and returns a pair of lists. The first list in the result contains all the elements that satisfy the predicate, the second contains all the ones that don't.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; partition (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "BOBsidneyMORGANeddy"
("BOBMORGAN","sidneyeddy")
ghci&gt; partition (&gt;3) [1,3,5,6,3,2,1,0,3,7]
([5,6,7],[1,3,3,2,1,0,3])
</pre>
<p>It's important to understand how this is different from <span class="fixed">span</span> and <span class="fixed">break</span>:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; span (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "BOBsidneyMORGANeddy"
("BOB","sidneyMORGANeddy")
</pre>
<p>While <span class="fixed">span</span> and <span class="fixed">break</span> are done once they encounter the first element that doesn't and does satisfy the predicate, <span class="fixed">partition</span> goes through the whole list and splits it up according to the predicate.</p>
<p><span class="label function">find</span> takes a list and a predicate and returns the first element that satisfies the predicate. But it returns that element wrapped in a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value. We'll be covering algebraic data types more in depth in the next chapter but for now, this is what you need to know: a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value can either be <span class="fixed">Just something</span> or <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. Much like a list can be either an empty list or a list with some elements, a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value can be either no elements or a single element. And like the type of a list of, say, integers is <span class="fixed">[Int]</span>, the type of maybe having an integer is <span class="fixed">Maybe Int</span>. Anyway, let's take our <span class="fixed">find</span> function for a spin.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; find (&gt;4) [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Just 5
ghci&gt; find (&gt;9) [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Nothing
ghci&gt; :t find
find :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Maybe a
</pre>
<p>Notice the type of <span class="fixed">find</span>. Its result is <span class="fixed">Maybe a</span>. That's kind of like having the type of <span class="fixed">[a]</span>, only a value of the type <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> can contain either no elements or one element, whereas a list can contain no elements, one element or several elements.</p>
<p>Remember when we were searching for the first time our stock went over $1000. We did <span class="fixed">head (dropWhile (\(val,y,m,d) -&gt; val &lt; 1000) stock)</span>. Remember that <span class="fixed">head</span> is not really safe. What would happen if our stock never went over $1000? Our application of <span class="fixed">dropWhile</span> would return an empty list and getting the head of an empty list would result in an error. However, if we rewrote that as <span class="fixed">find (\(val,y,m,d) -&gt; val &gt; 1000) stock</span>, we'd be much safer. If our stock never went over $1000 (so if no element satisfied the predicate), we'd get back a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. But there was a valid answer in that list, we'd get, say, <span class="fixed">Just (1001.4,2008,9,4)</span>.
<p><span class="label function">elemIndex</span> is kind of like <span class="fixed">elem</span>, only it doesn't return a boolean value. It maybe returns the index of the element we're looking for. If that element isn't in our list, it returns a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.  </p>

<p><span class="label function">elemIndices</span> is like <span class="fixed">elemIndex</span>, only it returns a list of indices, in case the element we're looking for crops up in our list several times.

<p>We already covered <span class="fixed">zip</span> and <span class="fixed">zipWith</span>. We noted that they zip together two lists, either in a tuple or with a binary function (meaning such a function that takes two parameters). But what if we want to zip together three lists? Or zip three lists with a function that takes three parameters? Well, for that, we have <span class="label function">zip3</span>, <span class="label function">zip4</span>, etc. and <span class="label function">zipWith3</span>, <span class="label function">zipWith4</span>, etc. These variants go up to 7. While this may look like a hack, it works out pretty fine, because there aren't many times when you want to zip 8 lists together. There's also a very clever way for zipping infinite numbers of lists, but we're not advanced enough to cover that just yet.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

<p>We've already mentioned <span class="label function">nub</span>. It takes a list and weeds out the duplicate elements, returning a list whose every element is a unique snowflake! The function does have a kind of strange name. It turns out that "nub" means a small lump or essential part of something. In my opinion, they should use real words for function names instead of old-people words.</p>

<p><span class="label function">\\</span> is the list difference function. It acts like a set difference, basically. For every element in the right-hand list, it removes a matching element in the left one.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

<p>Doing <span class="fixed">[1..10] \\ [2,5,9]</span> is like doing <span class="fixed">delete 2 . delete 5 . delete 9 $ [1..10]</span>.</p>
<p><span class="label function">union</span> also acts like a function on sets. It returns the union of two lists. It pretty much goes over every element in the second list and appends it to the first one if it isn't already in yet. Watch out though, duplicates are removed from the second list!</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

<p><span class="label function">intersect</span> works like set intersection. It returns only the elements that are found in both lists.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; [1..7] `intersect` [5..10]
[5,6,7]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">insert</span> takes an element and a list of elements that can be sorted and inserts it into the last position where it's still less than or equal to the next element. In other words, <span class="fixed">insert</span> will start at the beginning of the list and then keep going until it finds an element that's equal to or greater than the element that we're inserting and it will insert it just before the element.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; insert 4 [3,5,1,2,8,2]
[3,4,5,1,2,8,2]
ghci&gt; insert 4 [1,3,4,4,1]

</pre>
<p>The <span class="fixed">4</span> is inserted right after the <span class="fixed">3</span> and before the <span class="fixed">5</span> in the first example and in between the <span class="fixed">3</span> and <span class="fixed">4</span> in the second example.</p>
If we use <span class="fixed">insert</span> to insert into a sorted list, the resulting list will be kept sorted.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

<p>What <span class="fixed">length</span>, <span class="fixed">take</span>, <span class="fixed">drop</span>, <span class="fixed">splitAt</span>, <span class="fixed">!!</span> and <span class="fixed">replicate</span> have in common is that they take an <span class="fixed">Int</span> as one of their parameters (or return an <span class="fixed">Int</span>), even though they could be more generic and usable if they just took any type that's part of the <span class="fixed">Integral</span> or <span class="fixed">Num</span> typeclasses (depending on the functions). They do that for historical reasons. However, fixing that would probably break a lot of existing code. That's why <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> has their more generic equivalents, named <span class="label function">genericLength</span>, <span class="label function">genericTake</span>, <span class="label function">genericDrop</span>, <span class="label function">genericSplitAt</span>, <span class="label function">genericIndex</span> and <span class="label function">genericReplicate</span>. For instance, <span class="fixed">length</span> has a type signature of <span class="fixed">length :: [a] -&gt; Int</span>. If we try to get the average of a list of numbers by doing <span class="fixed">let xs = [1..6] in sum xs / length xs</span>, we get a type error, because you can't use <span class="fixed">/</span> with an <span class="fixed">Int</span>. <span class="fixed">genericLength</span>, on the other hand, has a type signature of <span class="fixed">genericLength :: (Num a) =&gt; [b] -&gt; a</span>. Because a <span class="fixed">Num</span> can act like a floating point number, getting the average by doing <span class="fixed">let xs = [1..6] in sum xs / genericLength xs</span> works out just fine.</p>
<p>The <span class="fixed">nub</span>, <span class="fixed">delete</span>, <span class="fixed">union</span>, <span class="fixed">intersect</span> and <span class="fixed">group</span> functions all have their more general counterparts called <span class="label function">nubBy</span>, <span class="label function">deleteBy</span>, <span class="label function">unionBy</span>, <span class="label function">intersectBy</span> and <span class="label function">groupBy</span>. The difference between them is that the first set of functions use <span class="fixed">==</span> to test for equality, whereas the <i>By</i> ones also take an equality function and then compare them by using that equality function. <span class="fixed">group</span> is the same as <span class="fixed">groupBy (==)</span>. </p>
<p>For instance, say we have a list that describes the value of a function for every second. We want to segment it into sublists based on when the value was below zero and when it went above. If we just did a normal <span class="fixed">group</span>, it would just group the equal adjacent values together. But what we want is to group them by whether they are negative or not. That's where <span class="fixed">groupBy</span> comes in! The equality function supplied to the <i>By</i> functions should take two elements of the same type and return <span class="fixed">True</span> if it considers them equal by its standards.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; let values = [-4.3, -2.4, -1.2, 0.4, 2.3, 5.9, 10.5, 29.1, 5.3, -2.4, -14.5, 2.9, 2.3]
ghci&gt; groupBy (\x y -&gt; (x &gt; 0) == (y &gt; 0)) values
[[-4.3,-2.4,-1.2],[0.4,2.3,5.9,10.5,29.1,5.3],[-2.4,-14.5],[2.9,2.3]]
</pre>
<p>From this, we clearly see which sections are positive and which are negative. The equality function supplied takes two elements and then returns <span class="fixed">True</span> only if they're both negative or if they're both positive. This equality function can also be written as <span class="fixed">\x y -&gt; (x &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (y &gt; 0) || (x &lt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (y &lt;= 0)</span>, although I think the first way is more readable. An even clearer way to write equality functions for the <i>By</i> functions is if you import the <span class="label function">on</span> function from <span class="fixed">Data.Function</span>. <span class="fixed">on</span> is defined like this:
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
on :: (b -&gt; b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; c
f `on` g = \x y -&gt; f (g x) (g y)
</pre>
<p>So doing <span class="fixed">(==) `on` (&gt; 0)</span> returns an equality function that looks like <span class="fixed">\x y -&gt; (x &gt; 0) == (y &gt; 0)</span>. <span class="fixed">on</span> is used a lot with the <i>By</i> functions because with it, we can do:
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; groupBy ((==) `on` (&gt; 0)) values
[[-4.3,-2.4,-1.2],[0.4,2.3,5.9,10.5,29.1,5.3],[-2.4,-14.5],[2.9,2.3]]
</pre>
<p>Very readable indeed! You can read it out loud: Group this by equality on whether the elements are greater than zero.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <span class="fixed">sort</span>, <span class="fixed">insert</span>, <span class="fixed">maximum</span> and <span class="fixed">minimum</span> also have their more general equivalents. Functions like <span class="fixed">groupBy</span> take a function that determines when two elements are equal. <span class="label function">sortBy</span>, <span class="label function">insertBy</span>, <span class="label function">maximumBy</span> and <span class="label function">minimumBy</span> take a function that determine if one element is greater, smaller or equal to the other. The type signature of <span class="fixed">sortBy</span> is <span class="fixed">sortBy :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Ordering) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</span>. If you remember from before, the <span class="fixed">Ordering</span> type can have a value of <span class="fixed">LT</span>, <span class="fixed">EQ</span> or <span class="fixed">GT</span>. <span class="fixed">sort</span> is the equivalent of <span class="fixed">sortBy compare</span>, because compare just takes two elements whose type is in the <span class="fixed">Ord</span> typeclass and returns their ordering relationship.</p>
<p>Lists can be compared, but when they are, they are compared lexicographically. What if we have a list of lists and we want to sort it not based on the inner lists' contents but on their lengths? Well, as you've probably guessed, we'll use the <span class="fixed">sortBy</span> function.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; let xs = [[5,4,5,4,4],[1,2,3],[3,5,4,3],[],[2],[2,2]]
ghci&gt; sortBy (compare `on` length) xs
[[],[2],[2,2],[1,2,3],[3,5,4,3],[5,4,5,4,4]]
</pre>
<p>Awesome! <span class="fixed">compare `on` length</span> ... man, that reads almost like real English! If you're not sure how exactly the <span class="fixed">on</span> works here, <span class="fixed">compare `on` length</span> is the equivalent of <span class="fixed">\x y -&gt; length x `compare` length y</span>. When you're dealing with <i>By</i> functions that take an equality function, you usually do <span class="fixed">(==) `on` something</span> and when you're dealing with <i>By</i> functions that take an ordering function, you usually do <span class="fixed">compare `on` something</span>.</p>
<a name="data-char"></a><h2>Data.Char</h2>
<img src="assets/images/modules/legochar.png" alt="lego char" class="right" width="230" height="323">
<p>The <span class="fixed">Data.Char</span> module does what its name suggests. It exports functions that deal with characters. It's also helpful when filtering and mapping over strings because they're just lists of characters.</p>
<p><span class="fixed">Data.Char</span> exports a bunch of predicates over characters. That is, functions that take a character and tell us whether some assumption about it is true or false. Here's what they are:</p>
<p><span class="label function">isControl</span> checks whether a character is a control character.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isSpace</span> checks whether a character is a white-space characters. That includes spaces, tab characters, newlines, etc.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isLower</span> checks whether a character is lower-cased. </p>
<p><span class="label function">isUpper</span> checks whether a character is upper-cased.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isAlpha</span> checks whether a character is a letter.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isAlphaNum</span> checks whether a character is a letter or a number.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isPrint</span> checks whether a character is printable. Control characters, for instance, are not printable.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isDigit</span> checks whether a character is a digit.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isOctDigit</span> checks whether a character is an octal digit.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isHexDigit</span> checks whether a character is a hex digit.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isLetter</span> checks whether a character is a letter.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isMark</span> checks for Unicode mark characters. Those are characters that combine with preceding letters to form latters with accents. Use this if you are French.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isNumber</span> checks whether a character is numeric.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isPunctuation</span> checks whether a character is punctuation.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isSymbol</span> checks whether a character is a fancy mathematical or currency symbol.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isSeparator</span> checks for Unicode spaces and separators.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isAscii</span> checks whether a character falls into the first 128 characters of the Unicode character set.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isLatin1</span> checks whether a character falls into the first 256 characters of Unicode.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isAsciiUpper</span> checks whether a character is ASCII and upper-case.</p>
<p><span class="label function">isAsciiLower</span> checks whether a character is ASCII and lower-case.</p>
<p>All these predicates have a type signature of <span class="fixed">Char -&gt; Bool</span>. Most of the time you'll use this to filter out strings or something like that. For instance, let's say we're making a program that takes a username and the username can only be comprised of alphanumeric characters. We can use the <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> function <span class="fixed">all</span> in combination with the <span class="fixed">Data.Char</span> predicates to determine if the username is alright.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; all isAlphaNum "bobby283"
True
ghci&gt; all isAlphaNum "eddy the fish!"
False
</pre>
<p>Kewl. In case you don't remember, <span class="fixed">all</span> takes a predicate and a list and returns <span class="fixed">True</span> only if that predicate holds for every element in the list.</p>
<p>We can also use <span class="fixed">isSpace</span> to simulate the <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> function <span class="fixed">words</span>.
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; words "hey guys its me"
["hey","guys","its","me"]
ghci&gt; groupBy ((==) `on` isSpace) "hey guys its me"
["hey"," ","guys"," ","its"," ","me"]
ghci&gt;
</pre>
<p>Hmmm, well, it kind of does what <span class="fixed">words</span> does but we're left with elements of only spaces. Hmm, whatever shall we do? I know, let's filter that sucker.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; filter (not . any isSpace) . groupBy ((==) `on` isSpace) $ "hey guys its me"
["hey","guys","its","me"]
</pre>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>The <span class="fixed">Data.Char</span> also exports a datatype that's kind of like <span class="fixed">Ordering</span>. The <span class="fixed">Ordering</span> type can have a value of <span class="fixed">LT</span>, <span class="fixed">EQ</span> or <span class="fixed">GT</span>. It's a sort of enumeration. It describes a few possible results that can arise from comparing two elements. The <span class="fixed">GeneralCategory</span> type is also an enumeration. It presents us with a few possible categories that a character can fall into. The main function for getting the general category of a character is <span class="fixed">generalCategory</span>. It has a type of <span class="fixed">generalCategory :: Char -&gt; GeneralCategory</span>. There are about 31 categories so we won't list them all here, but let's play around with the function.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; generalCategory ' '
Space
ghci&gt; generalCategory 'A'

ghci&gt; generalCategory '9'
DecimalNumber
ghci&gt; map generalCategory " \t\nA9?|"
[Space,Control,Control,UppercaseLetter,DecimalNumber,OtherPunctuation,MathSymbol]
</pre>
<p>Since the <span class="fixed">GeneralCategory</span> type is part of the <span class="fixed">Eq</span> typeclass, we can also test for stuff like <span class="fixed">generalCategory c == Space</span>.</p>
<p><span class="label function">toUpper</span> converts a character to upper-case. Spaces, numbers, and the like remain unchanged.</p>
<p><span class="label function">toLower</span> converts a character to lower-case.</p>
<p><span class="label function">toTitle</span> converts a character to title-case. For most characters, title-case is the same as upper-case.</p>
<p><span class="label function">digitToInt</span> converts a character to an <span class="fixed">Int</span>. To succeed, the character must be in the ranges <span class="fixed">'0'..'9'</span>, <span class="fixed">'a'..'f'</span> or <span class="fixed">'A'..'F'</span>.</p>

<p><span class="label function">intToDigit</span> is the inverse function of <span class="fixed">digitToInt</span>. It takes an <span class="fixed">Int</span> in the range of <span class="fixed">0..15</span> and converts it to a lower-case character.</p>

<p>The <span class="label function">ord</span> and <span class="fixed">chr</span> functions convert characters to their corresponding numbers and vice versa:</p>

ghci&gt; map ord "abcdefgh"

</pre>
<p>The difference between the <span class="fixed">ord</span> values of two characters is equal to how far apart they are in the Unicode table.</p><p>The Caesar cipher is a primitive method of encoding messages by shifting each character in them by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

<p>Here, we first convert the string to a list of numbers. Then we add the shift amount to each number before converting the list of numbers back to characters. If you're a composition cowboy, you could write the body of this function as <span class="fixed">map (chr . (+ shift) . ord) msg</span>. Let's try encoding a few messages.</p>

<p>Association lists (also called dictionaries) are lists that are used to store key-value pairs where ordering doesn't matter. For instance, we might use an association list to store phone numbers, where phone numbers would be the values and people's names would be the keys. We don't care in which order they're stored, we just want to get the right phone number for the right person.</p>
<p>The most obvious way to represent association lists in Haskell would be by having a list of pairs. The first component in the pair would be the key, the second component the value. Here's an example of an association list with phone numbers:</p>

<p>Despite this seemingly odd indentation, this is just a list of pairs of strings. The most common task when dealing with association lists is looking up some value by key. Let's make a function that looks up some value given a key.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
findKey :: (Eq k) =&gt; k -&gt; [(k,v)] -&gt; v
findKey key xs = snd . head . filter (\(k,v) -&gt; key == k) $ xs
</pre>
<p>Pretty simple. The function that takes a key and a list, filters the list so that only matching keys remain, gets the first key-value that matches and returns the value. But what happens if the key we're looking for isn't in the association list? Hmm. Here, if a key isn't in the association list, we'll end up trying to get the head of an empty list, which throws a runtime error. However, we should avoid making our programs so easy to crash, so let's use the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> data type. If we don't find the key, we'll return a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. If we find it, we'll return <span class="fixed">Just something</span>, where something is the value corresponding to that key.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
findKey :: (Eq k) =&gt; k -&gt; [(k,v)] -&gt; Maybe v
findKey key [] = Nothing
findKey key ((k,v):xs) = if key == k
                            then Just v
                            else findKey key xs
</pre>
<p>Look at the type declaration. It takes a key that can be equated, an association list and then it maybe produces a value. Sounds about right.</p>
<p>This is a textbook recursive function that operates on a list. Edge case, splitting a list into a head and a tail, recursive calls, they're all there. This is the classic fold pattern, so let's see how this would be implemented as a fold.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
findKey :: (Eq k) =&gt; k -&gt; [(k,v)] -&gt; Maybe v
findKey key = foldr (\(k,v) acc -&gt; if key == k then Just v else acc) Nothing
</pre>
<div class="hintbox"><em>Note:</em> It's usually better to use folds for this standard list recursion pattern instead of explicitly writing the recursion because they're easier to read and identify. Everyone knows it's a fold when they see the <span class="fixed">foldr</span> call, but it takes some more thinking to read explicit recursion.</div>

<p>Works like a charm! If we have the girl's phone number, we <span class="fixed">Just</span> get the number, otherwise we get <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.</p>
<p>We just implemented the <span class="fixed">lookup</span> function from <span class="fixed">Data.List</span>. If we want to find the corresponding value to a key, we have to traverse all the elements of the list until we find it. The <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> module offers association lists that are much faster (because they're internally implemented with trees) and also it provides a lot of utility functions. From now on, we'll say we're working with maps instead of association lists.</p>
<p>Because <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> exports functions that clash with the <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> and <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> ones, we'll do a qualified import.
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import qualified Data.Map as Map
</pre>
<p>Put this import statement into a script and then load the script via GHCI.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and see what <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> has in store for us! Here's the basic rundown of its functions.</p>
<p>The <span class="label function">fromList</span> function takes an association list (in the form of a list) and returns a map with the same associations.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.fromList [("betty","555-2938"),("bonnie","452-2928"),("lucille","205-2928")]
fromList [("betty","555-2938"),("bonnie","452-2928"),("lucille","205-2928")]
ghci&gt; Map.fromList [(1,2),(3,4),(3,2),(5,5)]
fromList [(1,2),(3,2),(5,5)]
</pre>
<p>If there are duplicate keys in the original association list, the duplicates are just discarded. This is the type signature of <span class="fixed">fromList</span></p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
Map.fromList :: (Ord k) =&gt; [(k, v)] -&gt; Map.Map k v
</pre>
<p>It says that it takes a list of pairs of type <span class="fixed">k</span> and <span class="fixed">v</span> and returns a map that maps from keys of type <span class="fixed">k</span> to type <span class="fixed">v</span>. Notice that when we were doing association lists with normal lists, the keys only had to be equatable (their type belonging to the <span class="fixed">Eq</span> typeclass) but now they have to be orderable. That's an essential constraint in the <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> module. It needs the keys to be orderable so it can arrange them in a tree.</p>
<p>You should always use <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span> for key-value associations unless you have keys that aren't part of the <span class="fixed">Ord</span> typeclass.</p>
<p><span class="label function">empty</span> represents an empty map. It takes no arguments, it just returns an empty map.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.empty
fromList []
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">insert</span> takes a key, a value and a map and returns a new map that's just like the old one, only with the key and value inserted.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.empty
fromList []
ghci&gt; Map.insert 3 100 Map.empty
fromList [(3,100)]
ghci&gt; Map.insert 5 600 (Map.insert 4 200 ( Map.insert 3 100  Map.empty))
fromList [(3,100),(4,200),(5,600)]
ghci&gt; Map.insert 5 600 . Map.insert 4 200 . Map.insert 3 100 $ Map.empty
fromList [(3,100),(4,200),(5,600)]
</pre>
<p>We can implement our own <span class="fixed">fromList</span> by using the empty map, <span class="fixed">insert</span> and a fold. Watch:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
fromList' :: (Ord k) =&gt; [(k,v)] -&gt; Map.Map k v
fromList' = foldr (\(k,v) acc -&gt; Map.insert k v acc) Map.empty
</pre>
<p>It's a pretty straightforward fold. We start of with an empty map and we fold it up from the right, inserting the key value pairs into the accumulator as we go along.</p>
<p><span class="label function">null</span> checks if a map is empty.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.null Map.empty
True
ghci&gt; Map.null $ Map.fromList [(2,3),(5,5)]
False
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">size</span> reports the size of a map.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.size Map.empty
0
ghci&gt; Map.size $ Map.fromList [(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,4),(6,4)]
5
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">singleton</span> takes a key and a value and creates a map that has exactly one mapping.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.singleton 3 9
fromList [(3,9)]
ghci&gt; Map.insert 5 9 $ Map.singleton 3 9
fromList [(3,9),(5,9)]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">lookup</span> works like the <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> <span class="fixed">lookup</span>, only it operates on maps. It returns <span class="fixed">Just something</span> if it finds something for the key and <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> if it doesn't.</p>
<p><span class="label function">member</span> is a predicate takes a key and a map and reports whether the key is in the map or not.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.member 3 $ Map.fromList [(3,6),(4,3),(6,9)]
True
ghci&gt; Map.member 3 $ Map.fromList [(2,5),(4,5)]
False
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">map</span> and <span class="label function">filter</span> work much like their list equivalents.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.map (*100) $ Map.fromList [(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)]
fromList [(1,100),(2,400),(3,900)]
ghci&gt; Map.filter isUpper $ Map.fromList [(1,'a'),(2,'A'),(3,'b'),(4,'B')]
fromList [(2,'A'),(4,'B')]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">toList</span> is the inverse of <span class="fixed">fromList</span>.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.toList . Map.insert 9 2 $ Map.singleton 4 3
[(4,3),(9,2)]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">keys</span> and <span class="label function">elems</span> return lists of keys and values respectively. <span class="fixed">keys</span> is the equivalent of <span class="fixed">map fst . Map.toList</span> and <span class="fixed">elems</span> is the equivalent of <span class="fixed">map snd . Map.toList</span>.</p>
<p><span class="label function">fromListWith</span> is a cool little function. It acts like <span class="fixed">fromList</span>, only it doesn't discard duplicate keys but it uses a function supplied to it to decide what to do with them. Let's say that a girl can have several numbers and we have an association list set up like this.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
phoneBook =
    [("betty","555-2938")
    ,("betty","342-2492")
    ,("bonnie","452-2928")
    ,("patsy","493-2928")
    ,("patsy","943-2929")
    ,("patsy","827-9162")
    ,("lucille","205-2928")
    ,("wendy","939-8282")
    ,("penny","853-2492")
    ,("penny","555-2111")
    ]
</pre>
<p>Now if we just use <span class="fixed">fromList</span> to put that into a map, we'll lose a few numbers! So here's what we'll do:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
phoneBookToMap :: (Ord k) =&gt; [(k, String)] -&gt; Map.Map k String
phoneBookToMap xs = Map.fromListWith (\number1 number2 -&gt; number1 ++ ", " ++ number2) xs
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Map.lookup "patsy" $ phoneBookToMap phoneBook
"827-9162, 943-2929, 493-2928"
ghci&gt; Map.lookup "wendy" $ phoneBookToMap phoneBook
"939-8282"
ghci&gt; Map.lookup "betty" $ phoneBookToMap phoneBook
"342-2492, 555-2938"
</pre>
<p>If a duplicate key is found, the function we pass is used to combine the values of those keys into some other value. We could also first make all the values in the association list singleton lists and then we can use <span class="fixed">++</span> to combine the numbers.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
phoneBookToMap :: (Ord k) =&gt; [(k, a)] -&gt; Map.Map k [a]
phoneBookToMap xs = Map.fromListWith (++) $ map (\(k,v) -&gt; (k,[v])) xs
</pre>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.lookup "patsy" $ phoneBookToMap phoneBook
["827-9162","943-2929","493-2928"]
</pre>
<p>Pretty neat! Another use case is if we're making a map from an association list of numbers and when a duplicate key is found, we want the biggest value for the key to be kept.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.fromListWith max [(2,3),(2,5),(2,100),(3,29),(3,22),(3,11),(4,22),(4,15)]
fromList [(2,100),(3,29),(4,22)]
</pre>
<p>Or we could choose to add together values on the same keys.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.fromListWith (+) [(2,3),(2,5),(2,100),(3,29),(3,22),(3,11),(4,22),(4,15)]
fromList [(2,108),(3,62),(4,37)]
</pre>
<p><span class="label function">insertWith</span> is to <span class="fixed">insert</span> what <span class="fixed">fromListWith</span> is to <span class="fixed">fromList</span>. It inserts a key-value pair into a map, but if that map already contains the key, it uses the function passed to it to determine what to do.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Map.insertWith (+) 3 100 $ Map.fromList [(3,4),(5,103),(6,339)]
fromList [(3,104),(5,103),(6,339)]
</pre>
<p>These were just a few functions from <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span>. You can see a complete list of functions in the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Map.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<a name="data-set"></a><h2>Data.Set</h2>
<img src="assets/images/modules/legosets.png" alt="legosets" class="right" width="150" height="236">
<p>The <span class="fixed">Data.Set</span> module offers us, well, sets. Like sets from mathematics. Sets are kind of like a cross between lists and maps. All the elements in a set are unique. And because they're internally implemented with trees (much like maps in <span class="fixed">Data.Map</span>), they're ordered. Checking for membership, inserting, deleting, etc. is much faster than doing the same thing with lists. The most common operation when dealing with sets are inserting into a set, checking for membership and converting a set to a list.</p>
<p>Because the names in <span class="fixed">Data.Set</span> clash with a lot of <span class="fixed">Prelude</span> and <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> names, we do a qualified import.</p>
<p>Put this import statement in a script:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
import qualified Data.Set as Set
</pre>
<p>And then load the script via GHCI.</p>
<p>Let's say we have two pieces of text. We want to find out which characters were used in both of them.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
text1 = "I just had an anime dream. Anime... Reality... Are they so different?"
text2 = "The old man left his garbage can out and now his trash is all over my lawn!"
</pre>
<p>
The <span class="label function">fromList</span> function works much like you would expect. It takes a list and converts it into a set.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">

ghci&gt; set1

ghci&gt; set2
fromList " !Tabcdefghilmnorstuvwy"
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the items are ordered and each element is unique. Now let's use the <span class="label function">intersection</span> function to see which elements they both share.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Set.intersection set1 set2
fromList " adefhilmnorstuy"
</pre>
<p>We can use the <span class="label function">difference</span> function to see which letters are in the first set but aren't in the second one and vice versa.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
ghci&gt; Set.difference set1 set2
fromList ".?AIRj"
ghci&gt; Set.difference set2 set1
fromList "!Tbcgvw"

<p>Or we can see all the unique letters used in both sentences by using <span class="label function">union</span>.</p>

<p>Sets are often used to weed a list of duplicates from a list by first making it into a set with <span class="fixed">fromList</span> and then converting it back to a list with <span class="label function">toList</span>. The <span class="fixed">Data.List</span> function <span class="fixed">nub</span> already does that, but weeding out duplicates for large lists is much faster if you cram them into a set and then convert them back to a list than using <span class="fixed">nub</span>. But using <span class="fixed">nub</span> only requires the type of the list's elements to be part of the <span class="fixed">Eq</span> typeclass, whereas if you want to cram elements into a set, the type of the list has to be in <span class="fixed">Ord</span>.</p>

<a name="making-our-own-modules"></a><h2>Making our own modules</h2>
<img src="assets/images/modules/making_modules.png" alt="making modules" class="right" width="345" height="224">
<p>We've looked at some cool modules so far, but how do we make our own module? Almost every programming language enables you to split your code up into several files and Haskell is no different. When making programs, it's good practice to take functions and types that work towards a similar purpose and put them in a module. That way, you can easily reuse those functions in other programs by just importing your module.</p>
<p>Let's see how we can make our own modules by making a little module that provides some functions for calculating the volume and area of a few geometrical objects. We'll start by creating a file called <span class="fixed">Geometry.hs</span>.</p>
<p>We say that a module <i>exports</i> functions. What that means is that when I import a module, I can use the functions that it exports. It can define functions that its functions call internally, but we can only see and use the ones that it exports.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a module, we specify the module name. If we have a file called <span class="fixed">Geometry.hs</span>, then we should name our module <span class="fixed">Geometry</span>. Then, we specify the functions that it exports and after that, we can start writing the functions. So we'll start with this.</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
module Geometry
( sphereVolume
, sphereArea
, cubeVolume
, cubeArea
, cuboidArea
, cuboidVolume
) where
</pre>
<p>As you can see, we'll be doing areas and volumes for spheres, cubes and cuboids. Let's go ahead and define our functions then:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
module Geometry
( sphereVolume
, sphereArea
, cubeVolume
, cubeArea
, cuboidArea
, cuboidVolume
) where

sphereVolume :: Float -&gt; Float
sphereVolume radius = (4.0 / 3.0) * pi * (radius ^ 3)

sphereArea :: Float -&gt; Float
sphereArea radius = 4 * pi * (radius ^ 2)

cubeVolume :: Float -&gt; Float
cubeVolume side = cuboidVolume side side side

cubeArea :: Float -&gt; Float
cubeArea side = cuboidArea side side side

cuboidVolume :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
cuboidVolume a b c = rectangleArea a b * c

cuboidArea :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
cuboidArea a b c = rectangleArea a b * 2 + rectangleArea a c * 2 + rectangleArea c b * 2

rectangleArea :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
rectangleArea a b = a * b
</pre>
<p>Pretty standard geometry right here. There are a few things to take note of though. Because a cube is only a special case of a cuboid, we defined its area and volume by treating it as a cuboid whose sides are all of the same length. We also defined a helper function called <span class="fixed">rectangleArea</span>, which calculates a rectangle's area based on the lenghts of its sides. It's rather trivial because it's just multiplication. Notice that we used it in our functions in the module (namely <span class="fixed">cuboidArea</span> and <span class="fixed">cuboidVolume</span>) but we didn't export it! Because we want our module to just present functions for dealing with three dimensional objects, we used <span class="fixed">rectangleArea</span> but we didn't export it.</p>
<p>When making a module, we usually export only those functions that act as a sort of interface to our module so that the implementation is hidden. If someone is using our <span class="fixed">Geometry</span> module, they don't have to concern themselves with functions that we don't export. We can decide to change those functions completely or delete them in a newer version (we could delete <span class="fixed">rectangleArea</span> and just use <span class="fixed">*</span> instead) and no one will mind because we weren't exporting them in the first place.</p>
<p>To use our module, we just do:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
import Geometry
</pre>
<p><span class="fixed">Geometry.hs</span> has to be in the same folder that the program that's importing it is in, though.</p>
<p>Modules can also be given a hierarchical structures. Each module can have a number of sub-modules and they can have sub-modules of their own. Let's section these functions off so that <span class="fixed">Geometry</span> is a module that has three sub-modules, one for each type of object.</p>
<p>First, we'll make a folder called <span class="fixed">Geometry</span>. Mind the capital G. In it, we'll place three files: <span class="fixed">Sphere.hs</span>, <span class="fixed">Cuboid.hs</span>, and <span class="fixed">Cube.hs</span>. Here's what the files will contain:</p>
<p><span class="fixed">Sphere.hs</span></p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
module Geometry.Sphere
( volume
, area
) where

volume :: Float -&gt; Float
volume radius = (4.0 / 3.0) * pi * (radius ^ 3)

area :: Float -&gt; Float
area radius = 4 * pi * (radius ^ 2)
</pre>
<p><span class="fixed">Cuboid.hs</span></p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
module Geometry.Cuboid
( volume
, area
) where

volume :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
volume a b c = rectangleArea a b * c

area :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
area a b c = rectangleArea a b * 2 + rectangleArea a c * 2 + rectangleArea c b * 2

rectangleArea :: Float -&gt; Float -&gt; Float
rectangleArea a b = a * b
</pre>
<p><span class="fixed">Cube.hs</span></p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
module Geometry.Cube
( volume
, area
) where

import qualified Geometry.Cuboid as Cuboid

volume :: Float -&gt; Float
volume side = Cuboid.volume side side side

area :: Float -&gt; Float
area side = Cuboid.area side side side
</pre>
<p>Alright! So first is <span class="fixed">Geometry.Sphere</span>. Notice how we placed it in a folder called <span class="fixed">Geometry</span> and then defined the module name as <span class="fixed">Geometry.Sphere</span>. We did the same for the cuboid. Also notice how in all three sub-modules, we defined functions with the same names. We can do this because they're separate modules. We want to use functions from <span class="fixed">Geometry.Cuboid</span> in <span class="fixed">Geometry.Cube</span> but we can't just straight up do <span class="fixed">import Geometry.Cuboid</span> because it exports functions with the same names as <span class="fixed">Geometry.Cube</span>. That's why we do a qualified import and all is well.</p>
<p>So now if we're in a file that's on the same level as the <span class="fixed">Geometry</span> folder, we can do, say:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
import Geometry.Sphere
</pre>
<p>And then we can call <span class="fixed">area</span> and <span class="fixed">volume</span> and they'll give us the area and volume for a sphere. And if we want to juggle two or more of these modules, we have to do qualified imports because they export functions with the same names. So we just do something like:</p>
<pre name="code" class="haskell:ghci">
import qualified Geometry.Sphere as Sphere
import qualified Geometry.Cuboid as Cuboid
import qualified Geometry.Cube as Cube
</pre>
<p>And then we can call <span class="fixed">Sphere.area</span>, <span class="fixed">Sphere.volume</span>, <span class="fixed">Cuboid.area</span>, etc. and each will calculate the area or volume for their corresponding object.</p>
<p>The next time you find yourself writing a file that's really big and has a lot of functions, try to see which functions serve some common purpose and then see if you can put them in their own module. You'll be able to just import your module the next time you're writing a program that requires some of the same functionality.</p>
