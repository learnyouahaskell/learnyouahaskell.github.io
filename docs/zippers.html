<p>
While Haskell's purity comes with a whole bunch of benefits, it makes us tackle
some problems differently than we would in impure languages. Because of
referential transparency, one value is as good as another in Haskell if it
represents the same thing.
</p>

<p>
So if we have a tree full of fives (high-fives, maybe?) and we want to change
one of them into a six, we have to have some way of knowing exactly which five
in our tree we want to change. We have to know where it is in our tree. In
impure languages, we could just note where in our memory the five is located and
change that. But in Haskell, one five is as good as another, so we can't
discriminate based on where in our memory they are. We also can't really
<i>change</i> anything; when we say that we change a tree, we actually
mean that we take a tree and return a new one that's similar to the original
tree, but slightly different.
</p>

<p>
One thing we can do is to remember a path from the root of the tree to the element
that we want to change. We could say, take this tree, go left, go right and then
left again and change the element that's there. While this works, it can be
inefficient. If we want to later change an element that's near the element that
we previously changed, we have to walk all the way from the root of the tree to
our element again!
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we'll see how we can take some data structure and focus on a
part of it in a way that makes changing its elements easy and walking around it
efficient. Nice!
</p>

<a name="taking-a-walk"></a>
<h2>Taking a walk</h2>

<p>
Like we've learned in biology class, there are many different kinds of trees, so
let's pick a seed that we will use to plant ours. Here it is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Tree a = Empty | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show)
</pre>

<p>
So our tree is either empty or it's a node that has an element and two
subtrees. Here's a fine example of such a tree, which I give to you, the
reader, for free!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
freeTree :: Tree Char
freeTree =
    Node 'P'
        (Node 'O'
            (Node 'L'
                (Node 'N' Empty Empty)
                (Node 'T' Empty Empty)
            )
            (Node 'Y'
                (Node 'S' Empty Empty)
                (Node 'A' Empty Empty)
            )
        )
        (Node 'L'
            (Node 'W'
                (Node 'C' Empty Empty)
                (Node 'R' Empty Empty)
            )
            (Node 'A'
                (Node 'A' Empty Empty)
                (Node 'C' Empty Empty)
            )
        )
</pre>

<p>
And here's this tree represented graphically:
</p>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/pollywantsa.png" alt="polly says her back hurts" class="center" width="780" height="504">

<p>
Notice that <span class="fixed">W</span> in the tree there? Say we want to
change it into a <span class="fixed">P</span>. How would we go about doing that?
Well, one way would be to pattern match on our tree until we find the element
that's located by first going right and then left and changing said element.
Here's the code for this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
changeToP :: Tree Char -&gt; Tree Char
changeToP (Node x l (Node y (Node _ m n) r)) = Node x l (Node y (Node 'P' m n) r)
</pre>

<p>
Yuck! Not only is this rather ugly, it's also kind of confusing. What happens
here? Well, we pattern match on our tree and name its root element
<span class="fixed">x</span> (that's becomes the <span class="fixed">'P'</span> in the
root) and its left subtree <span class="fixed">l</span>. Instead of giving a
name to its right subtree, we further pattern match on it. We continue this
pattern matching until we reach the subtree whose root is our <span
class="fixed">'W'</span>. Once we've done this, we rebuild the tree, only the
subtree that contained the <span class="fixed">'W'</span> at its root now
has a <span class="fixed">'P'</span>.
</p>

<p>
Is there a better way of doing this? How about we make our function take a tree
along with a list of directions. The directions will be either <span
class="fixed">L</span> or <span class="fixed">R</span>, representing left and
right respectively, and we'll change
the element that we arrive at if we follow the supplied directions. Here it is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Direction = L | R deriving (Show)
type Directions = [Direction]

changeToP :: Directions-&gt; Tree Char -&gt; Tree Char
changeToP (L:ds) (Node x l r) = Node x (changeToP ds l) r
changeToP (R:ds) (Node x l r) = Node x l (changeToP ds r)
changeToP [] (Node _ l r) = Node 'P' l r
</pre>

<p>
If the first element in our list of directions is <span
class="fixed">L</span>, we construct a new tree that's like the old tree, only
its left subtree has an element changed to <span class="fixed">'P'</span>. When
we recursively call <span class="fixed">changeToP</span>, we give it only the
tail of the list of directions, because we already took a left. We do the same
thing in the case of an <span class="fixed">R</span>. If the list of directions is
empty, that means that we're at our destination, so we return a tree that's like
the one supplied, only it has <span class="fixed">'P'</span> as its root
element.
</p>

<p>
To avoid printing out the whole tree, let's make a function that takes a list of
directions and tells us what the element at the destination is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
elemAt :: Directions -&gt; Tree a -&gt; a
elemAt (L:ds) (Node _ l _) = elemAt ds l
elemAt (R:ds) (Node _ _ r) = elemAt ds r
elemAt [] (Node x _ _) = x
</pre>

<p>
This function is actually quite similar to <span class="fixed">changeToP</span>,
only instead of remembering stuff along the way and reconstructing the tree, it
ignores everything except its destination. Here we change the <span
class="fixed">'W'</span> to a <span class="fixed">'P'</span> and see if the
change in our new tree sticks:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newTree = changeToP [R,L] freeTree
ghci&gt; elemAt [R,L] newTree
'P'
</pre>

<p>
Nice, this seems to work. In these functions, the list of directions acts as a
sort of <i>focus</i>, because it pinpoints one exact subtree from our tree.
A direction list of <span class="fixed">[R]</span> focuses on the subtree
that's right of the root, for example. An empty direction list focuses on the
main tree itself.
</p>

<p>
While this technique may seem cool, it can be rather inefficient, especially if
we want to repeatedly change elements. Say we have a really huge tree and a long
direction list that points to some element all the way at the bottom of the
tree. We use the direction list to take a walk along the tree and change an
element at the bottom. If we want to change another element that's close to the
element that we've just changed, we have to start from the root of the tree and
walk all the way to the bottom again! What a drag.
</p>

<p>
In the next section, we'll find a better way of focusing on a subtree, one that
allows us to efficiently switch focus to subtrees that are nearby.
</p>

<a name="a-trail-of-breadcrumbs"></a>
<h2>A trail of breadcrumbs</h2>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/bread.png" alt="whoop dee doo" class="right" width="321" height="250">

<p>
Okay, so for focusing on a subtree, we want something better than just a list
of directions that we always follow from the root of our tree. Would it help if
we start at the root of the tree and move either left or right one step at a
time and sort of leave breadcrumbs? That is, when we go left, we remember that
we went left and when we go right, we remember that we went right. Sure, we can
try that.
</p>

<p>
To represent our breadcrumbs, we'll also use a list of <span
class="fixed">Direction</span> (which is either <span class="fixed">L</span>
or <span class="fixed">R</span>), only instead of calling it
<span class="fixed">Directions</span>, we'll call it <span class="fixed">Breadcrumbs</span>
, because our directions will now be reversed since we're leaving them as
we go down our tree:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Breadcrumbs = [Direction]
</pre>

<p>
Here's a function that takes a tree and some breadcrumbs and moves to the left
subtree while adding <span class="fixed">L</span> to the head of the list that
represents our breadcrumbs:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goLeft :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs)
goLeft (Node _ l _, bs) = (l, L:bs)
</pre>

<p>
We ignore the element at the root and the right subtree and just return the
left subtree along with the old breadcrumbs with <span class="fixed">L</span>
as the head. Here's a function to go right:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goRight :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs)
goRight (Node _ _ r, bs) = (r, R:bs)
</pre>

<p>
It works the same way. Let's use these functions to take our
<span class="fixed">freeTree</span> and go right and then left:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; goLeft (goRight (freeTree, []))
(Node 'W' (Node 'C' Empty Empty) (Node 'R' Empty Empty),[L,R])
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/almostzipper.png" alt="almostthere" class="left" width="399" height="224">

<p>
Okay, so now we have a tree that has <span class="fixed">'W'</span>
in its root and <span class="fixed">'C'</span> in the root of its left subtree
and <span class="fixed">'R'</span> in the root of its right subtree. The
breadcrumbs are <span class="fixed">[L,R]</span>, because we first went right
and then left.
</p>

<p>
To make walking along our tree clearer, we can use the <span
class="fixed">-:</span> function that we defined like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
x -: f = f x
</pre>

<p>
Which allows us to apply functions to values by first writing the value, then
writing a <span class="fixed">-:</span> and then the function. So instead of
<span class="fixed">goRight (freeTree, [])</span>, we can write
<span class="fixed">(freeTree, []) -: goRight</span>. Using this, we can rewrite
the above so that it's more apparent that we're first going right and then left:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (freeTree, []) -: goRight -: goLeft
(Node 'W' (Node 'C' Empty Empty) (Node 'R' Empty Empty),[L,R])
</pre>

<h3>Going back up</h3>

<p>
What if we now want to go back up in our tree? From our breadcrumbs we know
that the current tree is the left subtree of its parent and that it is the
right subtree of its parent, but that's it. They don't tell us enough about the
parent of the current subtree for us to be able to
go up in the tree. It would seem that apart from the direction that we took, a
single breadcrumb should also contain all other data that we need to go back up.
In this case, that's the element in the parent tree along with its right
subtree.
</p>

<p>
In general, a single breadcrumb should contain all the data needed to
reconstruct the parent node. So it should have the information from all the paths
that we didn't take and it should also know the direction that we did take, but
it must not contain the subtree that we're currently focusing on. That's because
we already have that subtree in the first component of the tuple, so if we also
had it in the breadcrumbs, we'd have duplicate information.
</p>

<p>
Let's modify our breadcrumbs so that they also contain information about everything
that we previously ignored when moving left and right. Instead of <span
class="fixed">Direction</span>, we'll make a new data type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data Crumb a = LeftCrumb a (Tree a) | RightCrumb a (Tree a) deriving (Show)
</pre>

<p>
Now, instead of just <span class="fixed">L</span>, we have a <span
class="fixed">LeftCrumb</span> that also contains the element in the node that we
moved from and the right tree that we didn't visit. Instead of <span
class="fixed">R</span>, we have <span class="fixed">RightCrumb</span>, which
contains the element in the node that we moved from and the left tree that we
didn't visit.
</p>

<p>
These breadcrumbs now contain all the data needed to recreate the tree that we
walked through. So instead of just being normal bread crumbs, they're now more
like floppy disks that we leave as we go along, because they contain a lot more
information than just the direction that we took.
</p>

<p>
In essence, every breadcrumb is now like a tree node with a hole in it. When we
move deeper into a tree, the breadcrumb carries all the information that the
node that we moved away from carried <i>except</i> the subtree that we chose to
focus on. It also has to note where the hole is. In the case of a
<span class="fixed">LeftCrumb</span>, we know that we moved left, so the
subtree that's missing is the left one.
</p>

<p>
Let's also change our <span class="fixed">Breadcrumbs</span> type synonym to
reflect this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Breadcrumbs a = [Crumb a]
</pre>

<p>
Next up, we have to modify the <span class="fixed">goLeft</span> and
<span class="fixed">goRight</span> functions to store information about the
paths that we didn't take in our breadcrumbs, instead of ignoring that
information like they did before. Here's <span class="fixed">goLeft</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goLeft :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
goLeft (Node x l r, bs) = (l, LeftCrumb x r:bs)
</pre>

<p>
You can see that it's very similar to our previous <span class="fixed">goLeft</span>,
only instead of just adding a <span class="fixed">L</span> to the head of our
list of breadcrumbs, we add a <span class="fixed">LeftCrumb</span> to signify
that we went left and we equip our <span class="fixed">LeftCrumb</span> with the
element in the node that we moved from (that's the <span class="fixed">x</span>)
and the right subtree that we chose not to visit.
</p>

<p>
Note that this function assumes that the current tree that's under focus isn't
<span class="fixed">Empty</span>. An empty tree doesn't have any subtrees, so
if we try to go left from an empty tree, an error will occur because the pattern
match on <span class="fixed">Node</span> won't succeed and there's no pattern
that takes care of <span class="fixed">Empty</span>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="fixed">goRight</span> is similar:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goRight :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
goRight (Node x l r, bs) = (r, RightCrumb x l:bs)
</pre>

<p>
We were previously able to go left and right. What we've gotten now is the
ability to actually go back up by remembering stuff about the parent nodes and
the paths that we didn't visit. Here's the <span class="fixed">goUp</span>
function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goUp :: (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a) -&gt; (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
goUp (t, LeftCrumb x r:bs) = (Node x t r, bs)
goUp (t, RightCrumb x l:bs) = (Node x l t, bs)
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/asstronaut.png" alt="asstronaut" class="left" width="511" height="433">

<p>
We're focusing on the tree <span class="fixed">t</span> and we check what the
latest <span class="fixed">Crumb</span> is. If it's a <span class="fixed">LeftCrumb</span>,
then we construct a new tree where our tree <span class="fixed">t</span> is the left
subtree and we use the information about the right subtree that we didn't
visit and the element to fill out the rest of the <span class="fixed">Node</span>.
Because we moved back so to speak and picked up the last breadcrumb to recreate
with it the parent tree, the new list of breadcrumbs doesn't contain it.
</p>

<p>
Note that this function causes an error if we're already at the top of a tree
and we want to move up. Later on, we'll use the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>
monad to represent possible failure when moving focus.
</p>

<p>
With a pair of <span class="fixed">Tree a</span> and <span class="fixed">Breadcrumbs a</span>,
we have all the information to rebuild the whole tree and we also have a focus
on a subtree. This scheme also enables us to easily move up, left and right.
Such a pair that contains a focused part of a data structure and its surroundings is
called a zipper, because moving our focus up and down the data structure resembles the
operation of a zipper on a regular pair of pants. So it's cool to make a type
synonym as such:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Zipper a = (Tree a, Breadcrumbs a)
</pre>

<p>
I'd prefer naming the type synonym <span class="fixed">Focus</span> because that
makes it clearer that we're focusing on a part of a data structure, but the term
zipper is more widely used to describe such a setup, so we'll stick with
<span class="fixed">Zipper</span>.
</p>

<h3>Manipulating trees under focus</h3>

<p>
Now that we can move up and down, let's make a function that
modifies the element in the root of the subtree that the zipper is focusing on:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
modify :: (a -&gt; a) -&gt; Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
modify f (Node x l r, bs) = (Node (f x) l r, bs)
modify f (Empty, bs) = (Empty, bs)
</pre>

<p>
If we're focusing on a node, we modify its root element with the function
<span class="fixed">f</span>. If we're focusing on an empty tree, we leave it as
it is.  Now we can start off with a tree, move to anywhere we want and modify an
element, all while keeping focus on that element so that we can easily move
further up or down. An example:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus = modify (\_ -&gt; 'P') (goRight (goLeft (freeTree,[])))
</pre>

<p>
We go left, then right and then modify the root element by replacing it with a
<span class="fixed">'P'</span>. This reads even better if we use <span
class="fixed">-:</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus = (freeTree,[]) -: goLeft -: goRight -: modify (\_ -&gt; 'P')
</pre>

<p>
We can then move up if we want and replace an
element with a mysterious <span class="fixed">'X'</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus2 = modify (\_ -&gt; 'X') (goUp newFocus)
</pre>

<p>
Or if we wrote it with <span class="fixed">-:</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus2 = newFocus -: goUp -: modify (\_ -&gt; 'X')
</pre>

<p>
Moving up is easy because the breadcrumbs that we leave form the part of the
data structure that we're not focusing on, but it's inverted, sort of like turning a
sock inside out. That's why when we want to move up, we don't have to start from
the root and make our way down, but we just take the top of our inverted tree,
thereby un-inverting a part of it and adding it to our focus.
</p>

<p>
Each node has two subtrees, even if those subtrees are empty trees. So if
we're focusing on an empty subtree, one thing we can do is to replace it with a
non-empty subtree, thus attaching a tree to a leaf node. The code for this is
simple:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
attach :: Tree a -&gt; Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
attach t (_, bs) = (t, bs)
</pre>

<p>
We take a tree and a zipper and return a new zipper that has its focus replaced
with the supplied tree. Not only can we extend trees this way by replacing empty
subtrees with new trees, we can also replace whole existing subtrees. Let's
attach a tree to the far left of our <span class="fixed">freeTree</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let farLeft = (freeTree,[]) -: goLeft -: goLeft -: goLeft -: goLeft
ghci&gt; let newFocus = farLeft -: attach (Node 'Z' Empty Empty)
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">newFocus</span> is now focused on the tree that we just
attached and the rest of the tree lies inverted in the breadcrumbs. If we were
to use <span class="fixed">goUp</span> to walk all the way to the top of the
tree, it would be the same tree as <span class="fixed">freeTree</span> but with
an additional <span class="fixed">'Z'</span> on its far left.
</p>

<h3>I'm going straight to the top, oh yeah, up where the air is fresh and clean!</h3>

<p>
Making a function that walks all the way to the top of the tree, regardless of
what we're focusing on, is really easy. Here it is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
topMost :: Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
topMost (t,[]) = (t,[])
topMost z = topMost (goUp z)
</pre>

<p>
If our trail of beefed up breadcrumbs is empty, this means that we're already at
the root of our tree, so we just return the current focus. Otherwise, we go up
to get the focus of the parent node and then recursively apply <span
class="fixed">topMost</span> to that. So now we can walk around our tree, going
left and right and up, applying <span class="fixed">modify</span> and
<span class="fixed">attach</span> as we go along and then when we're done with
our modifications, we use <span class="fixed">topMost</span> to focus on the
root of our tree and see the changes that we've done in proper perspective.
</p>

<a name="focusing-on-lists"></a>
<h2>Focusing on lists</h2>

<p>
Zippers can be used with pretty much any data structure, so it's no surprise
that they can be used to focus on sub-lists of lists. After all, lists are
pretty much like trees, only where a node in a tree has an element (or not) and
several subtrees, a node in a list has an element and only a single sub-list.
When we <a href="making-our-own-types-and-typeclasses.html#recursive-data-structures">implemented
our own lists</a>, we defined our data type like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/picard.png" alt="the best damn thing" class="right" width="355" height="380">

<p>
Contrast this with our definition of our binary tree and it's easy to see how
lists can be viewed as trees where each node has only one subtree.
</p>

<p>
A list like <span class="fixed">[1,2,3]</span> can be written as
<span class="fixed">1:2:3:[]</span>. It consists of the head of the list, which
is <span class="fixed">1</span> and then the list's tail, which is
<span class="fixed">2:3:[]</span>. In turn, <span class="fixed">2:3:[]</span>
also has a head, which is <span class="fixed">2</span> and a tail, which is
<span class="fixed">3:[]</span>. With <span class="fixed">3:[]</span>, the
<span class="fixed">3</span> is the head and the tail is the empty list
<span class="fixed">[]</span>.
</p>

<p>
Let's make a zipper for lists. To change the focus on sub-lists of a list, we move either
forward or back (whereas with trees we moved either up or left or right). The
focused part will be a subtree and along with that we'll leave breadcrumbs as
we move forward. Now what would a single breadcrumb for a list consist of? When
we were dealing with binary trees, we said that a breadcrumb has to hold the
element in the root of the parent node along with all the subtrees that we
didn't choose. It also had to remember if we went left or right. So, it had to
have all the information that a node has except for the subtree that we chose
to focus on.
</p>

<p>
Lists are simpler than trees, so we don't have to remember if we
went left or right, because there's only one way to go deeper into a list.
Because there's only one subtree to each node, we don't have to remember the
paths that we didn't take either. It seems that all we have to remember is the
previous element. If we have a list like <span class="fixed">[3,4,5]</span> and
we know that the previous element was <span class="fixed">2</span>, we can go
back by just putting that element at the head of our list, getting <span
class="fixed">[2,3,4,5]</span>.
</p>

<p>
Because a single breadcrumb here is just the element, we don't really have to
put it inside a data type, like we did when we made the <span
class="fixed">Crumb</span> data type for tree zippers:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type ListZipper a = ([a],[a])
</pre>

<p>
The first list represents the list that we're focusing on and the second list
is the list of breadcrumbs. Let's make functions that go forward and back
into lists:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goForward :: ListZipper a -&gt; ListZipper a
goForward (x:xs, bs) = (xs, x:bs)

goBack :: ListZipper a -&gt; ListZipper a
goBack (xs, b:bs) = (b:xs, bs)
</pre>

<p>
When we're going forward, we focus on the tail of the current list and leave the
head element as a breadcrumb. When we're moving backwards, we take the latest
breadcrumb and put it at the beginning of the list.
</p>

<p>
Here are these two functions in action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let xs = [1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; goForward (xs,[])
([2,3,4],[1])
ghci&gt; goForward ([2,3,4],[1])
([3,4],[2,1])
ghci&gt; goForward ([3,4],[2,1])
([4],[3,2,1])
ghci&gt; goBack ([4],[3,2,1])
([3,4],[2,1])
</pre>

<p>
We see that the breadcrumbs in the case of lists are nothing more but a reversed
part of our list. The element that we move away from always goes into the head
of the breadcrumbs, so it's easy to move back by just taking that element from
the head of the breadcrumbs and making it the head of our focus.
</p>

<p>
This also makes it easier to see why we call this a zipper, because this really
looks like the slider of a zipper moving up and down.
</p>

<p>
If you were making a text editor, you could use a list of strings to represent
the lines of text that are currently opened and you could then use a zipper so
that you know which line the cursor is currently focused on. By using a zipper,
it would also make it easier to insert new lines anywhere in the text or delete
existing ones.
</p>

<a name="a-very-simple-file-system"></a>
<h2>A very simple file system</h2>

<p>
Now that we know how zippers work, let's use trees to represent a very simple
file system and then make a zipper for that file system, which will allow us to
move between folders, just like we usually do when jumping around our file
system.
</p>

<p>
If we take a simplistic view of the average hierarchical file system, we see
that it's mostly made up of files and folders. Files are units of data and come
with a name, whereas folders are used to organize those files and can contain
files or other folders. So let's say that an item in a file system is either a
file, which comes with a name and some data, or a folder, which has a name and
then a bunch of items that are either files or folders themselves. Here's a data
type for this and some type synonyms so we know what's what:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Name = String
type Data = String
data FSItem = File Name Data | Folder Name [FSItem] deriving (Show)
</pre>

<p>
A file comes with two strings, which represent its name and the data it holds. A
folder comes with a string that is its name and a list of items. If that list is
empty, then we have an empty folder.
</p>

<p>
Here's a folder with some files and sub-folders:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
myDisk :: FSItem
myDisk =
    Folder "root"
        [ File "goat_yelling_like_man.wmv" "baaaaaa"
        , File "pope_time.avi" "god bless"
        , Folder "pics"
            [ File "ape_throwing_up.jpg" "bleargh"
            , File "watermelon_smash.gif" "smash!!"
            , File "skull_man(scary).bmp" "Yikes!"
            ]
        , File "dijon_poupon.doc" "best mustard"
        , Folder "programs"
            [ File "fartwizard.exe" "10gotofart"
            , File "owl_bandit.dmg" "mov eax, h00t"
            , File "not_a_virus.exe" "really not a virus"
            , Folder "source code"
                [ File "best_hs_prog.hs" "main = print (fix error)"
                , File "random.hs" "main = print 4"
                ]
            ]
        ]
</pre>

<p>
That's actually what my disk contains right now.
</p>

<h3>A zipper for our file system</h3>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/spongedisk.png" alt="spongedisk" class="right" width="243" height="271">

<p>
Now that we have a file system, all we need is a zipper so we can zip and zoom
around it and add, modify and remove files as well as folders. Like with binary
trees and lists, we're going to be leaving breadcrumbs that contain info about
all the stuff that we chose not to visit. Like we said, a single breadcrumb
should be kind of like a node, only it should contain everything except the
subtree that we're currently focusing on. It should also note where the hole
is so that once we move back up, we can plug our previous focus into the hole.
</p>

<p>
In this case, a breadcrumb should be like a folder, only it should be missing
the folder that we currently chose. Why not like a file, you ask? Well, because
once we're focusing on a file, we can't move deeper into the file system, so it
doesn't make sense to leave a breadcrumb that says that we came from a file. A
file is sort of like an empty tree.
</p>

<p>
If we're focusing on the folder <span class="fixed">"root"</span> and we then
focus on the file <span class="fixed">"dijon_poupon.doc"</span>, what should the
breadcrumb that we leave look like? Well, it should contain the name of its
parent folder along with the items that come before the file that we're focusing
on and the items that come after it. So all we need is a <span
class="fixed">Name</span> and two lists of items. By keeping separate lists for
the items that come before the item that we're focusing and for the items that
come after it, we know exactly where to place it once we move back up. So this
way, we know where the hole is.
</p>

<p>
Here's our breadcrumb type for the file system:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
data FSCrumb = FSCrumb Name [FSItem] [FSItem] deriving (Show)
</pre>

<p>
And here's a type synonym for our zipper:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type FSZipper = (FSItem, [FSCrumb])
</pre>

<p>
Going back up in the hierarchy is very simple. We just take the latest
breadcrumb and assemble a new focus from the current focus and breadcrumb.
Like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fsUp :: FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsUp (item, FSCrumb name ls rs:bs) = (Folder name (ls ++ [item] ++ rs), bs)
</pre>

<p>
Because our breadcrumb knew what the parent folder's name was, as well as the
items that came before our focused item in the folder (that's <span
class="fixed">ls</span>) and the ones that came after (that's <span
class="fixed">rs</span>), moving up was easy.
</p>

<p>
How about going deeper into the file system? If we're in the
<span class="fixed">"root"</span> and we want to focus on
<span class="fixed">"dijon_poupon.doc"</span>, the breadcrumb that we leave is going to
include the name <span class="fixed">"root"</span> along with the items that
precede <span class="fixed">"dijon_poupon.doc"</span> and the ones that come
after it.
</p>

<p>
Here's a function that, given a name, focuses on a file of folder that's located
in the current focused folder:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
import Data.List (break)

fsTo :: Name -&gt; FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsTo name (Folder folderName items, bs) =
    let (ls, item:rs) = break (nameIs name) items
    in  (item, FSCrumb folderName ls rs:bs)

nameIs :: Name -&gt; FSItem -&gt; Bool
nameIs name (Folder folderName _) = name == folderName
nameIs name (File fileName _) = name == fileName
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">fsTo</span> takes a <span class="fixed">Name</span> and a
<span class="fixed">FSZipper</span>
and returns a new <span class="fixed">FSZipper</span> that focuses on the file
with the given name. That file has to be in the current focused folder. This
function doesn't search all over the place, it just looks at the current folder.
</p>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/cool.png" alt="wow cool great" class="left" width="205" height="197">

<p>
First we use <span class="fixed">break</span> to break the list of items in a
folder into those that precede the file that we're searching for and those that
come after it. If you remember, <span class="fixed">break</span> takes a
predicate and a list and returns a pair of lists. The first list in the pair
holds items for which the predicate returns <span class="fixed">False</span>.
Then, once the predicate returns <span class="fixed">True</span> for an item, it
places that item and the rest of the list in the second item of the pair. We
made an auxiliary function called <span class="fixed">nameIs</span> that takes
a name and a file system item and returns <span class="fixed">True</span> if
the names match.
</p>

<p>
So now, <span class="fixed">ls</span> is a list that contains the items that
precede the item that we're searching for, <span class="fixed">item</span> is
that very item and <span class="fixed">rs</span> is the list of items that come
after it in its folder. Now that we have this, we just present the item that we
got from <span class="fixed">break</span> as the focus and build a breadcrumb
that has all the data it needs.
</p>

<p>
Note that if the name we're looking for isn't in the folder, the pattern
<span class="fixed">item:rs</span> will try to match on an empty list and we'll
get an error. Also, if our current focus isn't a folder at all but a file, we
get an error as well and the program crashes.
</p>

<p>
Now we can move up and down our file system. Let's start at the root and walk to
the file <span class="fixed">"skull_man(scary).bmp"</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus = (myDisk,[]) -: fsTo "pics" -: fsTo "skull_man(scary).bmp"
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">newFocus</span> is now a zipper that's focused on the
<span class="fixed">"skull_man(scary).bmp"</span> file. Let's get the first
component of the zipper (the focus itself) and see if that's really true:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fst newFocus
File "skull_man(scary).bmp" "Yikes!"
</pre>

<p>
Let's move up and then focus on its neighboring file
<span class="fixed">"watermelon_smash.gif"</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus2 = newFocus -: fsUp -: fsTo "watermelon_smash.gif"
ghci&gt; fst newFocus2
File "watermelon_smash.gif" "smash!!"
</pre>

<h3>Manipulating our file system</h3>

<p>
Now that we know how to navigate our file system, manipulating it is easy.
Here's a function that renames the currently focused file or folder:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fsRename :: Name -&gt; FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsRename newName (Folder name items, bs) = (Folder newName items, bs)
fsRename newName (File name dat, bs) = (File newName dat, bs)
</pre>

<p>
Now we can rename our <span class="fixed">"pics"</span> folder to
<span class="fixed">"cspi"</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus = (myDisk,[]) -: fsTo "pics" -: fsRename "cspi" -: fsUp
</pre>

<p>
We descended to the <span class="fixed">"pics"</span> folder, renamed it and
then moved back up.
</p>

<p>
How about a function that makes a new item in the current folder? Behold:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fsNewFile :: FSItem -&gt; FSZipper -&gt; FSZipper
fsNewFile item (Folder folderName items, bs) =
    (Folder folderName (item:items), bs)
</pre>

<p>
Easy as pie. Note that this would crash if we tried to add an item but weren't
focusing on a folder, but were focusing on a file instead.
</p>

<p>
Let's add a file to our <span class="fixed">"pics"</span> folder and then move
back up to the root:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let newFocus = (myDisk,[]) -: fsTo "pics" -: fsNewFile (File "heh.jpg" "lol") -: fsUp
</pre>

<p>
What's really cool about all this is that when we modify our file system, it
doesn't actually modify it in place but it returns a whole new file system. That way, we
have access to our old file system (in this case, <span class="fixed">myDisk</span>)
as well as the new one (the first component of <span class="fixed">newFocus</span>).
So by using zippers, we get versioning for free, meaning that we can always
refer to older versions of data structures even after we've changed them, so to
speak. This isn't unique to zippers, but is a property of Haskell because its
data structures are immutable. With zippers however, we get the ability to
easily and efficiently walk around our data structures, so the persistence of
Haskell's data structures really begins to shine.
</p>

<a name="watch-your-step"></a>
<h2>Watch your step</h2>

<p>
So far, while walking through our data structures, whether they were binary
trees, lists or file systems, we didn't really care if we took a step too far
and fell off. For instance, our <span class="fixed">goLeft</span> function takes
a zipper of a binary tree and moves the focus to its left subtree:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goLeft :: Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
goLeft (Node x l r, bs) = (l, LeftCrumb x r:bs)
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/zippers/bigtree.png" alt="falling for you" class="right" width="247" height="367">

<p>
But what if the tree we're stepping off from is an empty tree? That is, what if
it's not a <span class="fixed">Node</span>, but an <span class="fixed">Empty</span>?
In this case, we'd get a runtime error because the pattern match would fail and
we have made no pattern to handle an empty tree, which doesn't have any
subtrees at all. So far, we just assumed that we'd never try to focus on the
left subtree of an empty tree as its left subtree doesn't exist at all. But
going to the left subtree of an empty tree doesn't make much sense, and so far
we've just conveniently ignored this.
</p>

<p>
Or what if we were already at the root of some tree and didn't have any
breadcrumbs but still tried to move up? The same thing would happen. It seems
that when using zippers, any step could be our last (cue ominous music). In
other words, any move can result in a success, but it can also result in a
failure. Does that remind you of something? Of course, monads! More
specifically, the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad which adds a context of
possible failure to normal values.
</p>

<p>
So let's use the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad to add a context of
possible failure to our movements. We're going to take the functions that work
on our binary tree zipper and we're going to make them into monadic functions.
First, let's take care of possible failure in <span class="fixed">goLeft</span>
and <span class="fixed">goRight</span>. So far, the failure of functions that
could fail was always reflected in their result, and this time is no
different. So here are <span class="fixed">goLeft</span> and
<span class="fixed">goRight</span> with an added possibility of failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goLeft :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
goLeft (Node x l r, bs) = Just (l, LeftCrumb x r:bs)
goLeft (Empty, _) = Nothing

goRight :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
goRight (Node x l r, bs) = Just (r, RightCrumb x l:bs)
goRight (Empty, _) = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Cool, now if we try to take a step to the left of an empty tree, we get a
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span>!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; goLeft (Empty, [])
Nothing
ghci&gt; goLeft (Node 'A' Empty Empty, [])
Just (Empty,[LeftCrumb 'A' Empty])
</pre>

<p>
Looks good! How about going up? The problem before happened if we tried to go up but
we didn't have any more breadcrumbs, which meant that we were already in the
root of the tree. This is the <span class="fixed">goUp</span> function that
throws an error if we don't keep within the bounds of our tree:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goUp :: Zipper a -&gt; Zipper a
goUp (t, LeftCrumb x r:bs) = (Node x t r, bs)
goUp (t, RightCrumb x l:bs) = (Node x l t, bs)
</pre>

<p>
Now let's modify it to fail gracefully:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
goUp :: Zipper a -&gt; Maybe (Zipper a)
goUp (t, LeftCrumb x r:bs) = Just (Node x t r, bs)
goUp (t, RightCrumb x l:bs) = Just (Node x l t, bs)
goUp (_, []) = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
If we have breadcrumbs, everything is okay and we return a successful new focus,
but if we don't, then we return a failure.
</p>

<p>
Before, these functions took zippers and returned zippers, which meant that we
could chain them like this to walk around:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
gchi&gt; let newFocus = (freeTree,[]) -: goLeft -: goRight
</pre>

<p>
But now, instead of returning <span class="fixed">Zipper a</span>, they return
<span class="fixed">Maybe (Zipper a)</span>, so chaining functions like this
won't work. We had a similar problem when we
were <a href="a-fistful-of-monads.html#walk-the-line">dealing with our tightrope
walker</a> in the chapter about monads. He also walked one step at a time and
each of his steps could result in failure because a bunch of birds could land on
one side of his balancing pole and make him fall.
</p>

<p>
Now, the joke's on us because
we're the ones doing the walking, and we're traversing a labyrinth of our own
devising. Luckily, we can learn from the tightrope walker and just do what he
did, which is to exchange normal
function application for using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, which takes
a value with a context (in our case, the <span class="fixed">Maybe (Zipper a)</span>,
which has a context of possible failure) and feeds it into a function while
making sure that the context is taken care of. So just like our tightrope walker, we're
going to trade in all our <span class="fixed">-:</span> operators for
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>. Alright, we can chain our functions again!
Watch:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let coolTree = Node 1 Empty (Node 3 Empty Empty)
ghci&gt; return (coolTree,[]) &gt;&gt;= goRight
Just (Node 3 Empty Empty,[RightCrumb 1 Empty])
ghci&gt; return (coolTree,[]) &gt;&gt;= goRight &gt;&gt;= goRight
Just (Empty,[RightCrumb 3 Empty,RightCrumb 1 Empty])
ghci&gt; return (coolTree,[]) &gt;&gt;= goRight &gt;&gt;= goRight &gt;&gt;= goRight
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
We used <span class="fixed">return</span> to put a zipper in a <span
class="fixed">Just</span> and then used <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to
feed that to our <span class="fixed">goRight</span> function. First, we made a
tree that has on its left an empty subtree and on its right a node that has two
empty subtrees. When we try to go right once, the result is a success, because
the operation makes sense. Going right twice is okay too; we end up with the
focus on an empty subtree. But going right three times wouldn't make sense,
because we can't go to the right of an empty subtree, which is why the
result is a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>

<p>
Now we've equipped our trees with a safety-net that will catch us should
we fall off. Wow, I nailed this metaphor.
</p>

<p>
Our file system also has a lot of cases where an operation could fail, such as
trying to focus on a file or folder that doesn't exist. As an exercise, you can
equip our file system with functions that fail gracefully by using the
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad.
