        <h1>A Fistful of Monads</h1>

<p>
When we first talked about functors, we saw that they were a useful concept for
values that can be mapped over. Then, we took that concept one step further by
introducing applicative functors, which allow us to view values of certain data
types as values with contexts and use normal functions on those values while
preserving the meaning of those contexts.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we'll learn about
monads, which are just beefed up applicative functors, much like
applicative functors are only beefed up functors.
</p>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/smugpig.png" alt="more cool than u" class="right" width="307" height="186">

<p>
When we started off with functors, we saw that it's possible to map functions
over various data types. We saw that for this purpose, the <span class="fixed">Functor</span>
type class was introduced and it had us asking the question: when we have a
function of type <span class="fixed">a -&gt; b</span> and some data type
<span class="fixed">f a</span>, how do we map that function over the data type
to end up with <span class="fixed">f b</span>? We saw how to map something over
a <span class="fixed">Maybe a</span>, a list <span class="fixed">[a]</span>, an <span class="fixed">IO
a</span> etc. We even saw how to map a function <span class="fixed">a -&gt; b</span>
over other functions of type <span class="fixed">r -&gt; a</span> to get
functions of type <span class="fixed">r -&gt; b</span>. To answer this question
of how to map a function over some data type, all we had to do was look at the type
of <span class="fixed">fmap</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fmap :: (Functor f) =&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>

<p>
And then make it work for our data type by writing the appropriate <span
class="fixed">Functor</span> instance.
</p>

<p>
Then we saw a possible improvement of functors and said, hey, what if that
function <span class="fixed">a -&gt; b</span> is already wrapped inside a
functor value? Like, what if we have <span class="fixed">Just (*3)</span>, how
do we apply that to <span class="fixed">Just 5</span>? What if we don't want to
apply it to <span class="fixed">Just 5</span> but to a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span> instead? Or if we have <span class="fixed">[(*2),(+4)]</span>,
how would we apply that to <span class="fixed">[1,2,3]</span>? How would that
work even? For this, the <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class was
introduced, in which we wanted the answer to the following type:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&lt;*&gt;) :: (Applicative f) =&gt; f (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
</pre>

<p>
We also saw that we can take a normal value and wrap it inside a data type. For
instance, we can take a
<span class="fixed">1</span> and wrap it so that it becomes a
<span class="fixed">Just 1</span>. Or we can make it into a <span
class="fixed">[1]</span>. Or an I/O action that does nothing and just yields
<span class="fixed">1</span>. The function that does this is called <span
class="fixed">pure</span>.
</p>

<p>
Like we said, an applicative value can be seen as a value with an added context.
A <i>fancy</i> value, to put it in technical terms. For instance, the character <span
class="fixed">'a'</span> is just a normal character, whereas <span
class="fixed">Just 'a'</span> has some added context. Instead of a <span
class="fixed">Char</span>, we have a <span class="fixed">Maybe Char</span>,
which tells us that its value might be a character, but it could also be an
absence of a character.
</p>

<p>
It was neat to see how the <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class
allowed us to use normal functions on these values with context and how that
context was preserved. Observe:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; Just 2 &lt;*&gt; Just 8
Just 16
ghci&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; Just "klingon" &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
ghci&gt; (-) &lt;$&gt; [3,4] &lt;*&gt; [1,2,3]
[2,1,0,3,2,1]
</pre>

<p>
Ah, cool, so now that we treat them as applicative values, <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> values represent computations that might have
failed, <span class="fixed">[a]</span> values represent computations that have
several results (non-deterministic computations), <span class="fixed">IO
a</span> values represent values that have side-effects, etc.
</p>

<p>
Monads are a natural extension of applicative functors and with them we're
concerned with this: if you have a value with a context, <span class="fixed">m
a</span>, how do you apply to it a function that takes a normal <span
class="fixed">a</span> and returns a value with a context? That is, how do you
apply a function of type <span class="fixed">a -&gt; m b</span> to a value of
type <span class="fixed">m a</span>? So essentially, we will want this function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&gt;&gt;=) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b
</pre>

<p>
<b>If we have a fancy value and a function that takes a normal value but
returns a fancy value, how do we feed that fancy value into the function?</b> This
is the main question that we will concern ourselves when dealing with monads. We write
<span class="fixed">m a</span> instead of <span class="fixed">f a</span> because
the <span class="fixed">m</span> stands for <span class="fixed">Monad</span>, but monads are just
applicative functors that support <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>. The
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> function is pronounced as <i>bind</i>.
</p>

<p>
When we have a normal value <span class="fixed">a</span> and a normal function
<span class="fixed">a -&gt; b</span> it's really easy to feed the value to the
function &mdash; you just apply the function to the value normally and that's
it. But when we're dealing with values that come with certain contexts, it takes
a bit of thinking to see how these fancy values are fed to functions and how to
take into account their behavior, but you'll see that it's easy as one two
three.

<h2>Getting our feet wet with Maybe</h2>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/buddha.png" alt="monads, grasshoppa" class="left" width="302" height="387">

<p>
Now that we have a vague idea of what monads are about, let's see if we can make
that idea a bit less vague.
</p>

<p>
Much to no one's surprise, <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> is a monad, so let's
explore it a bit more and see if we can combine it with what we know about
monads.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
Make sure you understand <a href="functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids.html#applicative-functors">applicatives</a> at this point. It's good if you have a
feel for how the various <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> instances work
and what kind of computations they represent, because monads are nothing more
than taking our existing applicative knowledge and upgrading it.
</div>

<p>
A value of type <span class="fixed">Maybe a</span> represents a value of type
<span class="fixed">a</span> with the context of possible failure attached. A
value of <span class="fixed">Just "dharma"</span> means that the string <span
class="fixed">"dharma"</span> is there whereas a value of
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span> represents its absence, or if you look at the
string as the result of a computation, it means that the computation has failed.
</p>

<p>
When we looked at <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> as a functor, we saw that if
we want to <span class="fixed">fmap</span> a function over it, it gets mapped
over the insides if it's a <span class="fixed">Just</span> value, otherwise the
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span> is kept because there's nothing to map it
over!
</p>

<p>
Like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; fmap (++"!") (Just "wisdom")
Just "wisdom!"
ghci&gt; fmap (++"!") Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
As an applicative functor, it functions similarly. However, applicatives also
have the function wrapped. <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> is an applicative
functor in such a way that when we use <span class="fixed">&lt;*&gt;</span> to
apply a function inside a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> to a value that's
inside a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>, they both have to be <span
class="fixed">Just</span> values for the result to be a <span
class="fixed">Just</span> value, otherwise the result is <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. It makes sense because if you're missing either
the function or the thing you're applying it to, you can't make something up out
of thin air, so you have to propagate the failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just (+3) &lt;*&gt; Just 3
Just 6
ghci&gt; Nothing &lt;*&gt; Just "greed"
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just ord &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
When we use the applicative style to have normal functions act on <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> values, it's similar. All the values have to be <span
class="fixed">Just</span> values, otherwise it's all for <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; max &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Just 6
Just 6
ghci&gt; max &lt;$&gt; Just 3 &lt;*&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
And now, let's think about how we would do <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
for <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>. Like we said, <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
takes a monadic value, and a function that takes a normal value and returns a
monadic value and manages to apply that function to the monadic value. How does
it do that, if the function takes a normal value? Well, to do that, it has to
take into account the context of that monadic value.
</p>

<p>
In this case, <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> would take a <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> value and a function of type <span class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe b</span>
and somehow apply the function to the <span class="fixed">Maybe a</span>. To
figure out how it does that, we can use the intuition that we have from <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> being an applicative functor. Let's say that we have
a function <span class="fixed">\x -&gt; Just (x+1)</span>. It takes a number,
adds <span class="fixed">1</span> to it and wraps it in a <span
class="fixed">Just</span>:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+1)) 1
Just 2
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+1)) 100
Just 101
</pre>

<p>
If we feed it <span class="fixed">1</span>, it evaluates to <span
class="fixed">Just 2</span>. If we give it the number <span
class="fixed">100</span>, the result is <span class="fixed">Just 101</span>.
Very straightforward. Now here's the kicker: how do we feed a
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value to this function? If we think about how
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> acts as an applicative functor, answering this
is pretty easy. If we feed it a <span class="fixed">Just</span> value, take what's inside
the <span class="fixed">Just</span> and apply the function to it. If give it
a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, hmm, well, then we're left with a
function but <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> to apply it to. In that case,
let's just do what we did before and say that the result is <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of calling it <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, let's call it
<span class="fixed">applyMaybe</span> for now. It takes a <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> and a function that returns a <span
class="fixed">Maybe b</span> and manages to apply that function to the <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span>. Here it is in code:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
applyMaybe :: Maybe a -&gt; (a -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; Maybe b
applyMaybe Nothing f  = Nothing
applyMaybe (Just x) f = f x
</pre>

<p>
Okay, now let's play with it for a bit. We'll use it as an infix function so that
the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value is on the left side and the function on
the right:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x+1)
Just 4
ghci&gt; Just "smile" `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x ++ " :)")
Just "smile :)"
ghci&gt; Nothing `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x+1)
Nothing
ghci&gt; Nothing `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; Just (x ++ " :)")
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
In the above example, we see that when we used <span class="fixed">applyMaybe</span> with a <span class="fixed">Just</span> value and a function, the function simply got applied to the value inside the <span class="fixed">Just</span>. When we tried to use it with a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the whole result was <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
What about if the function returns a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>? Let's
see:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; if x &gt; 2 then Just x else Nothing
Just 3
ghci&gt; Just 1 `applyMaybe` \x -&gt; if x &gt; 2 then Just x else Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Just what we expected. If the monadic value on the left is a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the whole thing is <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
And if the function on the right returns a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>,
the result is <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> again. This is very similar to when
we used <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> as an applicative and we got a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span> result if somewhere in there was a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>.
</p>

<p>
It looks like that for <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>, we've figured out how
to take a fancy value and feed it to a function that takes a normal value and
returns a fancy one. We did this by keeping in mind that a <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value represents a computation that might have
failed.
</p>

<p>
You might be asking yourself, how is this useful? It may seem like applicative
functors are stronger than monads, since applicative functors allow us to take a
normal function and make it operate on values with contexts. We'll see that
monads can do that as well because they're an upgrade of applicative functors,
and that they can also do some cool stuff that applicative functors can't.
</p>

<p>
We'll come back to <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> in a minute, but first,
let's check out the type class that belongs to monads.
</p>

<a name="the-monad-type-class"></a>
<h2>The Monad type class</h2>

<p>
Just like functors have the <span class="fixed">Functor</span> type class and applicative
functors have the <span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class,
monads come with their own type class: <span class="fixed">Monad</span>! Wow,
who would have thought? This is what the type class looks like:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Monad m where
    return :: a -&gt; m a

    (&gt;&gt;=) :: m a -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; m b

    (&gt;&gt;) :: m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
    x &gt;&gt; y = x &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; y

    fail :: String -&gt; m a
    fail msg = error msg
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/kid.png" alt="this is you on monads" class="right" width="363" height="451">
<p>
Let's start with the first line. It says <span class="fixed">class Monad m where</span>.
But wait, didn't we say that monads are just beefed up applicative functors? Shouldn't
there be a class constraint in there along the lines of <span
class="fixed">class (Applicative m) = &gt; Monad m where</span> so that a type
has to be an applicative functor first before it can be made a monad? Well,
there should, but when Haskell was made, it hadn't occurred to people that
applicative functors are a good fit for Haskell so they weren't in there. But
rest assured, every monad is an applicative functor, even if the <span
class="fixed">Monad</span> class declaration doesn't say so.
</p>

<p>
The first function that the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> type class defines
is <span class="fixed">return</span>. It's the same as <span
class="fixed">pure</span>, only with a different name. Its type is <span
class="fixed">(Monad m) =&gt; a -&gt; m a</span>. It takes a value and puts it
in a minimal default context that still holds that value. In other words, it
takes something and wraps it in a monad. It always does the same thing as the
<span class="fixed">pure</span> function from the <span
class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class, which means we're already
acquainted with <span class="fixed">return</span>.  We already used <span
class="fixed">return</span> when doing I/O. We used it to take a value and make
a bogus I/O action that does nothing but yield that value.  For <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> it takes a value and wraps it in a <span
class="fixed">Just</span>.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
Just a reminder: <span class="fixed">return</span> is nothing like the
<span class="fixed">return</span> that's in most other languages. It doesn't end
function execution or anything, it just takes a normal value and puts it in a
context.
</div>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/tur2.png" alt="hmmm yaes" class="left" width="169" height="145">

<p>
The next function is <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, or bind. It's like
function application, only instead of taking a normal value and feeding it to a
normal function, it takes a monadic value (that is, a value with a context) and
feeds it to a function that takes a normal value but returns a monadic value.
</p>

<p>
Next up, we have <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span>. We won't pay too much
attention to it for now because it comes with a default implementation and we
pretty much never implement it when making <span class="fixed">Monad</span>
instances.
</p>

<p>
The final function of the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> type class is
<span class="fixed">fail</span>. We never use it explicitly in our code. Instead, it's used by Haskell to enable failure in a special syntactic construct for monads that we'll meet later. We don't need to concern ourselves with <span class="fixed">fail</span> too much for now.
</p>

<p>
Now that we know what the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> type class looks
like, let's take a look at how <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> is an instance
of <span class="fixed">Monad</span>!
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad Maybe where
    return x = Just x
    Nothing &gt;&gt;= f = Nothing
    Just x &gt;&gt;= f  = f x
    fail _ = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">return</span> is the same as <span
class="fixed">pure</span>, so that one's a no-brainer. We do what we did in the
<span class="fixed">Applicative</span> type class and wrap it in a <span
class="fixed">Just</span>.
</p>

<p>
The <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> function is the same as our
<span class="fixed">applyMaybe</span>. When feeding the <span
class="fixed">Maybe a</span> to our function, we keep in mind the context and
return a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> if the value on the left is <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span> because if there's no value then there's no way to
apply our function to it. If it's a <span class="fixed">Just</span> we take
what's inside and apply <span class="fixed">f</span> to it.
</p>

<p>
We can play around with <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> as a monad:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return "WHAT" :: Maybe String
Just "WHAT"
ghci&gt; Just 9 &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10)
Just 90
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10)
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Nothing new or exciting on the first line since we already used <span
class="fixed">pure</span> with <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> and we know that <span
class="fixed">return</span> is just <span class="fixed">pure</span> with a
different name. The next two lines showcase <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
a bit more.
</p>

<p>
Notice how when we fed <span class="fixed">Just 9</span> to the function <span
class="fixed">\x -&gt; return (x*10)</span>, the <span class="fixed">x</span>
took on the value <span class="fixed">9</span> inside the function. It seems as
though we were able to extract the value from a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>
without pattern-matching. And we still didn't lose the context of our <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value, because when it's <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>,
the result of using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> will be <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> as well.
</p>

<a name="walk-the-line"></a>
<h2>Walk the line</h2>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/pierre.png" alt="pierre" class="left" width="374" height="405">

<p>
Now that we know how to feed a <span class="fixed">Maybe a</span> value to a
function of type
<span class="fixed">a -&gt; Maybe b</span> while taking into account the context
of possible failure, let's see how we can use <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> repeatedly to handle computations of several
<span class="fixed">Maybe a</span> values.
</p>

<p>
Pierre has decided to take a break from his job at the fish farm and try
tightrope walking. He's not that bad at it, but he does have one problem: birds
keep landing on his balancing pole! They come and they take a short rest, chat
with their avian friends and then take off in search of breadcrumbs. This
wouldn't bother him so much if the number of birds on the left side of the pole
was always equal to the number of birds on the right side. But sometimes, all
the birds decide that they like one side better and so they throw him off
balance, which results in an embarrassing tumble for Pierre (he's using a safety
net).
</p>

<p>
Let's say that he keeps his balance if the number of birds on the left side of
the pole and on the right side of the pole is within three. So if there's
one bird on the right side and four birds on the left side, he's okay. But if a
fifth bird lands on the left side, then he loses his balance and takes a dive.
</p>

<p>
We're going to simulate birds landing on and flying away from the pole and see
if Pierre is still at it after a certain number of birdy arrivals and
departures. For instance, we want to see what happens to Pierre if first one
bird arrives on the left side, then four birds occupy the right side and then
the bird that was on the left side decides to fly away.
</p>

<p>
We can represent the pole with a simple pair of integers. The first component
will signify the number of birds on the left side and the second component the
number of birds on the right side:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type Birds = Int
type Pole = (Birds,Birds)
</pre>

<p>
First we made a type synonym for <span class="fixed">Int</span>, called
<span class="fixed">Birds</span>, because we're using integers to represent
how many birds there are. And then we made a type synonym <span class="fixed">(Birds,Birds)</span> and we called it <span class="fixed">Pole</span> (not to be
confused with a person of Polish descent).
</p>

<p>
Next up, how about we make a function that takes a number of birds and lands
them on one side of the pole. Here are the functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
landLeft :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Pole
landLeft n (left,right) = (left + n,right)

landRight :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Pole
landRight n (left,right) = (left,right + n)
</pre>

<p>
Pretty straightforward stuff. Let's try them out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (0,0)
(2,0)
ghci&gt; landRight 1 (1,2)
(1,3)
ghci&gt; landRight (-1) (1,2)
(1,1)
</pre>

<p>
To make birds fly away we just had a negative number of birds land on one side. Because
landing a bird on the <span class="fixed">Pole</span> returns a <span
class="fixed">Pole</span>, we can chain applications of <span
class="fixed">landLeft</span> and <span class="fixed">landRight</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (landRight 1 (landLeft 1 (0,0)))
(3,1)
</pre>

<p>
When we apply the function <span class="fixed">landLeft 1</span> to <span
class="fixed">(0,0)</span> we get <span
class="fixed">(1,0)</span>. Then, we land a bird on the right side, resulting
in <span class="fixed">(1,1)</span>. Finally two birds land on the left
side, resulting in <span class="fixed">(3,1)</span>. We apply a function to
something by first writing the function and then writing its parameter, but here
it would be better if the pole went first and then the landing function. If we
make a function like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
x -: f = f x
</pre>

<p>
We can apply functions by first writing the parameter and then the function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; 100 -: (*3)
300
ghci&gt; True -: not
False
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 2
(2,0)
</pre>

<p>
By using this, we can repeatedly land birds on the pole in a more readable
manner:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 1 -: landLeft 2
(3,1)
</pre>

<p>
Pretty cool! This example is equivalent to the one before where we repeatedly
landed birds on the pole, only it looks neater. Here, it's more obvious that we
start off with <span class="fixed">(0,0)</span> and then land one bird one the
left, then one on the right and finally two on the left.
</p>

<p>So far so good, but
what happens if 10 birds land on one side?
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 10 (0,3)
(10,3)
</pre>

<p>
10 birds on the left side and only 3 on the right? That's sure to send poor
Pierre falling through the air! This is pretty obvious here but what if we had a
sequence of landings like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 4 -: landLeft (-1) -: landRight (-2)
(0,2)
</pre>

<p>
It might seem like everything is okay but if you follow the steps here, you'll
see that at one time there are 4 birds on the right side and no birds on the
left! To fix this, we have to take another look at our <span
class="fixed">landLeft</span> and <span class="fixed">landRight</span>
functions. From what we've seen, we want these functions to be able to fail.
That is, we want them to return a new pole if the balance is okay but fail if
the birds land in a lopsided manner. And what better way to add a context of
failure to value than by using <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>! Let's rework
these functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
landLeft :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
landLeft n (left,right)
    | abs ((left + n) - right) &lt; 4 = Just (left + n, right)
    | otherwise                    = Nothing

landRight :: Birds -&gt; Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
landRight n (left,right)
    | abs (left - (right + n)) &lt; 4 = Just (left, right + n)
    | otherwise                    = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Instead of returning a <span class="fixed">Pole</span> these functions now
return a <span class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span>. They still take the number of
birds and the old pole as before, but then they check if landing that many birds
on the pole would throw Pierre off balance. We use guards to check if the
difference between the number of birds on the new pole is less than 4. If it is,
we wrap the new pole in a <span class="fixed">Just</span> and return that. If it
isn't, we return a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, indicating failure.
</p>

<p>
Let's give these babies a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landLeft 2 (0,0)
Just (2,0)
ghci&gt; landLeft 10 (0,3)
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Nice! When we land birds without throwing Pierre off balance, we get a new pole
wrapped in a <span class="fixed">Just</span>. But when many more birds end up on
one side of the pole, we get a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. This is cool,
but we seem to have lost the ability to repeatedly land birds on the pole. We
can't do <span class="fixed">landLeft 1 (landRight 1 (0,0))</span> any more
because when we apply <span class="fixed">landRight 1</span> to <span
class="fixed">(0,0)</span>, we don't get a <span class="fixed">Pole</span>, but
a <span class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span>. <span class="fixed">landLeft 1</span>
takes a <span class="fixed">Pole</span> and not a <span class="fixed">Maybe
Pole</span>.
</p>

<p>
We need a way of taking a <span class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span> and feeding it
to a function that takes a <span class="fixed">Pole</span> and returns a <span
class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span>. Luckily, we have <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>,
which does just that for <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>. Let's give it a go:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; landRight 1 (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2
Just (2,1)
</pre>

<p>
Remember, <span class="fixed">landLeft 2</span> has a type of <span
class="fixed">Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole</span>. We couldn't just feed it the <span
class="fixed">Maybe Pole</span> that is the result of <span
class="fixed">landRight 1 (0,0)</span>, so we use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to take that value with a context and give
it to <span class="fixed">landLeft 2</span>. <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> does indeed allow us to treat the <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span> value as a value with context because if we feed a
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span> into <span class="fixed">landLeft 2</span>,
the result is <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> and the failure is propagated:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
With this, we can now chain landings that may fail because <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> allows us to feed a
monadic value to a function that takes a normal one.
</p>

<p>
Here's a sequence of birdy landings:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2 &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2 &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)
</pre>

<p>
At the beginning, we used <span class="fixed">return</span> to take a pole and
wrap it in a <span class="fixed">Just</span>. We could have just applied <span
class="fixed">landRight 2</span> to <span class="fixed">(0,0)</span>, it would
have been the same, but this way we can be more consistent by using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
for every function.
<span class="fixed">Just (0,0)</span> gets fed to <span class="fixed">landRight
2</span>, resulting in <span class="fixed">Just (0,2)</span>. This, in turn,
gets fed to <span class="fixed">landLeft 2</span>, resulting in <span
class="fixed">Just (2,2)</span>, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Remember this example from before we introduced failure into Pierre's routine:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (0,0) -: landLeft 1 -: landRight 4 -: landLeft (-1) -: landRight (-2)
(0,2)
</pre>

<p>
It didn't simulate his interaction with birds very well because in the middle
there his balance was off but the result didn't reflect that. But let's give
that a go now by using monadic application (<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>)
instead of normal application:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt;= landRight 4 &gt;&gt;= landLeft (-1) &gt;&gt;= landRight (-2)
Nothing
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/banana.png" alt="iama banana" class="right" width="262" height="130">

<p>
Awesome. The final result represents failure, which is what we expected. Let's
see how this result was obtained. First, <span class="fixed">return</span> puts
 <span class="fixed">(0,0)</span> into a default context, making it a <span
 class="fixed">Just (0,0)</span>. Then, <span class="fixed">Just (0,0) &gt;&gt;=
 landLeft 1</span> happens. Since the <span class="fixed">Just (0,0)</span> is a <span
 class="fixed">Just</span> value, <span class="fixed">landLeft 1</span> gets applied
 to <span class="fixed">(0,0)</span>, resulting in a <span class="fixed">Just
 (1,0)</span>, because the birds are still relatively balanced. Next, <span
 class="fixed">Just (1,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 4</span> takes place and the
 result is <span class="fixed">Just (1,4)</span> as the balance of the birds is
 still intact, although just barely. <span class="fixed">Just (1,4)</span> gets
 fed to <span class="fixed">landLeft (-1)</span>. This means that <span
 class="fixed">landLeft (-1) (1,4)</span> takes place. Now because of how <span
 class="fixed">landLeft</span> works, this results in a <span
 class="fixed">Nothing</span>, because the resulting pole is off balance. Now
 that we have a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, it gets fed to <span
 class="fixed">landRight (-2)</span>, but because it's a <span
 class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the result is automatically <span
 class="fixed">Nothing</span>, as we have nothing to apply <span
 class="fixed">landRight (-2)</span> to.
</p>

<p>
We couldn't have achieved this by just using <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>
as an applicative. If you try it, you'll get stuck, because applicative functors
don't allow for the applicative values to interact with each other very much.
They can, at best, be used as parameters to a function by using the applicative
style. The applicative operators will fetch their results and feed them to the
function in a manner appropriate for each applicative and then put the final
applicative value together, but there isn't that much interaction going on
between them. Here, however, each step relies on the previous one's result. On
every landing, the possible result from the previous one is examined and the
pole is checked for balance. This determines whether the landing will succeed or
fail.
</p>

<p>
We may also devise a function that ignores the current number of birds on the
balancing pole and just makes Pierre slip and fall. We can call it <span
class="fixed">banana</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
banana :: Pole -&gt; Maybe Pole
banana _ = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
Now we can chain it together with our bird landings. It will always cause our walker
to fall, because it ignores whatever is passed to it and always returns a
failure. Check it:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt;= banana &gt;&gt;= landRight 1
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
The value <span class="fixed">Just (1,0)</span> gets fed to <span
class="fixed">banana</span>, but it produces a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, which
causes everything to result in a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. How
unfortunate!
</p>

<p>
Instead of making functions that ignore their input and just return a
predetermined monadic value, we can use the <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span>
function, whose default implementation is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&gt;&gt;) :: (Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; m b -&gt; m b
m &gt;&gt; n = m &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; n
</pre>

<p>
Normally, passing some value to a function that ignores its parameter and always
just returns some predetermined value would always result in that predetermined value. With
monads however, their context and meaning has to be considered as well. Here's
how <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span> acts with <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt; Just 3
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt; Just 4
Just 4
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt; Nothing
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
If you replace <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span> with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=
\_ -&gt;</span>, it's easy to see why it acts like it does.
</p>

<p>
We can replace our <span class="fixed">banana</span> function in the chain with a <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span> and then a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 1 &gt;&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= landRight 1
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
There we go, guaranteed and obvious failure!
</p>

<p>
It's also worth taking a look at what this would look like if we hadn't made the
clever choice of treating <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values as values with
a failure context and feeding them to functions like we did. Here's how a
series of bird landings would look like:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = case landLeft 1 (0,0) of
    Nothing -&gt; Nothing
    Just pole1 -&gt; case landRight 4 pole1 of
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just pole2 -&gt; case landLeft 2 pole2 of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just pole3 -&gt; landLeft 1 pole3
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/centaur.png" alt="john joe glanton" class="right" width="297" height="331">

<p>
We land a bird on the left and then we examine the possibility of failure and
the possibility of success. In the case of failure, we return a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. In the case of success, we land birds on the
right and then do the same thing all over again. Converting this monstrosity
into a neat chain of monadic applications with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
is a classic example of how the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad saves us
a lot of time when we have to successively do computations that are based on
computations that might have failed.
</p>

<p>
Notice how the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> implementation of <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> features exactly this logic of seeing if a value
is <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> and if it is, returning a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span> right away and if it isn't, going forward with what's
inside the <span class="fixed">Just</span>.
</p>

<p>
In this section, we took some functions that we had and saw that they would work
better if the values that they returned supported failure. By turning those
values into <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values and replacing normal
function application with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, we got a
mechanism for handling failure pretty much for free, because <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is supposed to preserve the context of the value
to which it applies functions. In this case, the context was that our values
were values with failure and so when we applied functions to such values, the
possibility of failure was always taken into account.
</p>

<a name="do-notation"></a>
<h2>do notation</h2>

<p>
Monads in Haskell are so useful that they got their own special syntax called
<span class="fixed">do</span> notation. We've already encountered <span
class="fixed">do</span> notation when we were doing I/O and there we said that
it was for gluing together several I/O actions into one. Well, as it turns out,
<span class="fixed">do</span> notation isn't just for <span class="fixed">IO</span>, but can be used
for any monad. Its principle is still the same: gluing together monadic
values in sequence. We're going to take a look at how <span
class="fixed">do</span> notation works and why it's useful.
</p>

<p>
Consider this familiar example of monadic application:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (show x ++ "!"))
Just "3!"
</pre>

<p>
Been there, done that. Feeding a monadic value to a function that returns one,
no big deal. Notice how when we do this, <span class="fixed">x</span> becomes
<span class="fixed">3</span> inside the lambda. Once we're inside that lambda,
it's just a normal value rather than a monadic value. Now, what if we had another
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
inside that function? Check this out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Just "3!"
</pre>

<p>
Ah, a nested use of <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>! In the outermost
lambda, we feed <span class="fixed">Just "!"</span> to the lambda <span
class="fixed">\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)</span>. Inside this lambda, the <span
class="fixed">y</span> becomes <span class="fixed">"!"</span>. <span
class="fixed">x</span> is still <span class="fixed">3</span> because we got it
from the outer lambda. All this sort of reminds me of the following expression:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let x = 3; y = "!" in show x ++ y
"3!"
</pre>

<p>
The main difference between these two is that the values in the former example
are monadic. They're values with a failure context. We can replace any of them
with a failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Nothing &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Just (show x ++ y)))
Nothing
ghci&gt; Just 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt; Nothing))
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
In the first line, feeding a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> to a function
naturally results in a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. In the second line,
we feed <span class="fixed">Just 3</span> to a function and the <span
class="fixed">x</span> becomes <span class="fixed">3</span>, but then we feed a
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span> to the inner lambda and the result of that is
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, which causes the outer lambda to produce
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span> as well. So this is sort of like assigning
values to variables in <span class="fixed">let</span> expressions, only that the
values in question are monadic values.
</p>

<p>
To further illustrate this point, let's write this in a script and have each
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value take up its own line:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foo :: Maybe String
foo = Just 3   &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt;
      Just "!" &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt;
      Just (show x ++ y)))
</pre>

<p>
To save us from writing all these annoying lambdas, Haskell gives us
<span class="fixed">do</span> notation. It allows us to write the previous piece
of code like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
foo :: Maybe String
foo = do
    x &lt;- Just 3
    y &lt;- Just "!"
    Just (show x ++ y)
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/owld.png" alt="90s owl" class="right" width="269" height="348">

<p>
It would seem as though we've gained the ability to temporarily extract things
from <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values without having to check if the
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values are <span class="fixed">Just</span>
values or <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> values at every step. How cool! If any of the
values that we try to extract from are <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>, the
whole <span class="fixed">do</span> expression will result in a <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>. We're yanking out their (possibly existing) values
and letting <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> worry about the context that
comes with those values. It's important to remember that
<span class="fixed">do</span> expressions are just different syntax for chaining
monadic values.
</p>

<p>
In a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression, every line is a monadic value. To
inspect its result, we use <span class="fixed">&lt;-</span>. If we have a
<span class="fixed">Maybe String</span> and we bind it with <span
class="fixed">&lt;-</span> to a variable, that variable will be a <span
class="fixed">String</span>, just like when we used <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
to feed monadic values to lambdas. The last monadic value in a  <span
class="fixed">do</span> expression, like <span class="fixed">Just (show x ++ y)</span> here,
can't be used with <span class="fixed">&lt;-</span> to bind its result, because that
wouldn't make sense if we translated the <span class="fixed">do</span>
expression
back to a chain of <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> applications. Rather,
its result is the result of the whole glued up monadic value, taking into
account the possible failure of any previous ones.
</p>

<p>
For instance, examine the following line:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just 9 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (x &gt; 8))
Just True
</pre>

<p>
Because the left parameter of <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is a
<span class="fixed">Just</span> value, the lambda is applied to <span
class="fixed">9</span> and the result is a <span class="fixed">Just True</span>. If we
rewrite this in <span class="fixed">do</span> notation, we get:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
marySue :: Maybe Bool
marySue = do
    x &lt;- Just 9
    Just (x &gt; 8)
</pre>

<p>
If we compare these two, it's easy to see why the result of the whole monadic
value is the result of the last monadic value in the <span class="fixed">do</span>
expression with all the previous ones chained into it.
</p>

<p>
Our tightrope walker's routine can also be expressed with <span class="fixed">do</span>
notation. <span class="fixed">landLeft</span> and <span class="fixed">landRight</span>
take a number of birds and a pole and produce a pole wrapped in a <span
class="fixed">Just</span>, unless the tightrope walker
slips, in which case a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> is produced. We used
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to chain successive steps because each one
relied on the previous one and each one had an added context of possible
failure. Here's two birds landing on the left side, then two birds landing on
the right and then one bird landing on the left:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = do
    start &lt;- return (0,0)
    first &lt;- landLeft 2 start
    second &lt;- landRight 2 first
    landLeft 1 second
</pre>

<p>
Let's see if he succeeds:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; routine
Just (3,2)
</pre>

<p>
He does! Great. When we were doing these routines by explicitly writing
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, we usually said something like
<span class="fixed">return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2</span>, because
<span class="fixed">landLeft 2</span> is a function that returns a
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value. With <span class="fixed">do</span>
expressions however, each line must feature a monadic value. So we explicitly pass
the previous <span class="fixed">Pole</span> to the <span class="fixed">landLeft</span>
<span class="fixed">landRight</span> functions. If we examined the variables to
which we bound our <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values, <span
class="fixed">start</span> would be <span class="fixed">(0,0)</span>, <span
class="fixed">first</span> would be <span class="fixed">(2,0)</span> and so on.
</p>

<p>
Because <span class="fixed">do</span> expressions are written line by line, they may look
like imperative code to some people. But the thing is, they're just sequential, as each value in
each line relies on the result of the previous ones, along with their contexts
(in this case, whether they succeeded or failed).
</p>

<p>Again, let's take a look at what this piece of code would look like if we hadn't
used the monadic aspects of <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>:</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine =
    case Just (0,0) of
        Nothing -&gt; Nothing
        Just start -&gt; case landLeft 2 start of
            Nothing -&gt; Nothing
            Just first -&gt; case landRight 2 first of
                Nothing -&gt; Nothing
                Just second -&gt; landLeft 1 second
</pre>

<p>
See how in the case of success, the tuple inside <span class="fixed">Just
(0,0)</span> becomes <span class="fixed">start</span>, the result of
<span class="fixed">landLeft 2 start</span> becomes <span class="fixed">first</span>, etc.
</p>

<p>
If we want to throw the Pierre a banana peel in <span class="fixed">do</span>
notation, we can do the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
routine :: Maybe Pole
routine = do
    start &lt;- return (0,0)
    first &lt;- landLeft 2 start
    Nothing
    second &lt;- landRight 2 first
    landLeft 1 second
</pre>

<p>
When we write a line in <span class="fixed">do</span> notation without binding
the monadic value with <span class="fixed">&lt;-</span>, it's just like putting
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span> after the monadic value whose result we
want to ignore. We sequence the monadic value but we ignore its result because
we don't care what it is and it's prettier than writing
<span class="fixed">_ &lt;- Nothing</span>, which is equivalent to the above.
</p>

<p>
When to use <span class="fixed">do</span> notation and when to explicitly use
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is up to you. I think this example lends
itself to explicitly writing <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> because each
step relies specifically on the result of the previous one. With <span
class="fixed">do</span> notation, we had to specifically write on which pole the
birds are landing, but every time we used that came directly before. But still,
it gave us some insight into <span class="fixed">do</span> notation.
</p>

<p>
In <span class="fixed">do</span> notation, when we bind monadic values to
names, we can utilize pattern matching, just like in <span class="fixed">let</span>
expressions and function parameters. Here's an example of pattern matching in a
<span class="fixed">do</span> expression:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
justH :: Maybe Char
justH = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- Just "hello"
    return x
</pre>

<p>
We use pattern matching to get the first character of the string <span class="fixed">"hello"</span>
and then we present it as the result. So <span class="fixed">justH</span> evaluates to
<span class="fixed">Just 'h'</span>.
</p>

<p>
What if this pattern matching were to
fail? When matching on a pattern in a function fails, the next pattern is
matched. If the matching falls through all the patterns for a given function, an
error is thrown and our program crashes. On the other hand, failed pattern
matching in <span class="fixed">let</span> expressions results in an error being
produced right away, because the mechanism of falling through patterns isn't
present in <span class="fixed">let</span> expressions. When pattern matching
fails in a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression, the <span
class="fixed">fail</span> function is called. It's part of the <span
class="fixed">Monad</span> type class and it enables failed pattern matching to
result in a failure in the context of the current monad instead of making our
program crash. Its default implementation is this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fail :: (Monad m) =&gt; String -&gt; m a
fail msg = error msg
</pre>

<p>
So by default it does make our program crash, but monads that incorporate a
context of possible failure (like <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>) usually
implement it on their own. For <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>, its implemented
like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
fail _ = Nothing
</pre>

<p>
It ignores the error message and makes a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. So
when pattern matching fails in a <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> value that's
written in <span class="fixed">do</span> notation, the whole value results in a
<span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. This is preferable to having our program
crash. Here's a <span class="fixed">do</span> expression with a pattern that's
bound to fail:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
wopwop :: Maybe Char
wopwop = do
    (x:xs) &lt;- Just ""
    return x
</pre>

<p>
The pattern matching fails, so the effect is the same as if the whole line with
the pattern was replaced with a <span class="fixed">Nothing</span>. Let's try
this out:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; wopwop
Nothing
</pre>

<p>
The failed pattern matching has caused a failure within the context of our
monad instead of causing a program-wide failure, which is pretty neat.

<p>
So far, we've seen how <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values can be viewed as
values with a failure context and how we can incorporate failure handling into
our code by using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed them to functions.
In this section, we're going to take a look at how to use the monadic aspects of
lists to bring non-determinism into our code in a clear and readable manner.
</p>

<p>
We've already talked about how lists represent non-deterministic values
when they're used as applicatives. A value like <span class="fixed">5</span>
is deterministic. It has only one result and we know exactly what it is. On the
other hand, a value like <span class="fixed">[3,8,9]</span> contains several
results, so we can view it as one value that is actually many values at the same
time. Using lists as applicative functors showcases this
non-determinism nicely:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (*) &lt;$&gt; [1,2,3] &lt;*&gt; [10,100,1000]
[10,100,1000,20,200,2000,30,300,3000]
</pre>

<p>
All the possible combinations of multiplying elements from the left list with
elements from the right list are included in the resulting list. When dealing
with non-determinism, there are many choices that we can make, so we just try
all of them, and so the result is a non-deterministic value as well, only it has
many more results.
</p>

<p>
This context of non-determinism translates to monads very nicely. Let's go ahead
and see what the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> instance for lists looks like:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance Monad [] where
    return x = [x]
    xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)
    fail _ = []
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">return</span> does the same thing as <span
class="fixed">pure</span>, so we should already be familiar with
<span class="fixed">return</span> for lists. It takes a value and puts it in a
minimal default context that still yields that value. In other words, it makes a
list that has only that one value as its result. This is useful for when we want
to just wrap a normal value into a list so that it can interact with
non-deterministic values.
</p>

<p>
To understand how <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> works for lists, it's
best if we take a look at it in action to gain some intuition first. <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is about taking a value with a context (a monadic
value) and feeding it to a function that takes a normal value and returns one
that has context. If that function just produced a normal value instead of one
with a context, <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> wouldn't be so useful
because after one use, the context would be lost. Anyway, let's try feeding a
non-deterministic value to a function:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [3,4,5] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; [x,-x]
[3,-3,4,-4,5,-5]
</pre>

<p>
When we used <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> with <span
class="fixed">Maybe</span>, the monadic value was fed into the function while
taking care of possible failures. Here, it takes care of non-determinism for us.
<span class="fixed">[3,4,5]</span> is a non-deterministic value and we feed it
into a function that returns a non-deterministic value as well. The result is
also non-deterministic, and it features all the possible results of taking
elements from the list <span class="fixed">[3,4,5]</span> and passing them to
the function <span class="fixed">\x -&gt; [x,-x]</span>. This function takes a
number and produces two results: one negated and one that's unchanged. So when
we use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed this list to the function,
every number is negated and also kept unchanged. The <span class="fixed">x</span>
from the lambda takes on every value from the list that's fed to it.
</p>

<p>
To see how this is achieved, we can just follow the implementation. First, we
start off with the list <span class="fixed">[3,4,5]</span>. Then, we map the
lambda over it and the result is the following:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
[[3,-3],[4,-4],[5,-5]]
</pre>

<p>
The lambda is applied to every element and we get a list of lists. Finally, we
just flatten the list and voilà! We've applied a non-deterministic function to a
non-deterministic value!
</p>

<p>
Non-determinism also includes support for failure. The empty list <span
class="fixed">[]</span> is pretty much the equivalent of <span
class="fixed">Nothing</span>, because it signifies the absence of a result.
That's why failing is just defined as the empty list. The error message gets
thrown away. Let's play around with lists that fail:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; ["bad","mad","rad"]
[]
ghci&gt; [1,2,3] &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; []
[]
</pre>

<p>
In the first line, an empty list is fed into the lambda. Because the list has no
elements, none of them can be passed to the function and so the result is an
empty list. This is similar to feeding <span class="fixed">Nothing</span> to a
function. In the second line, each element gets passed to the function, but the
element is ignored and the function just returns an empty list. Because the
function fails for every element that goes in it, the result is a failure.
</p>

<p>
Just like with <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> values, we can chain several
lists with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, propagating the
non-determinism:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [1,2] &gt;&gt;= \n -&gt; ['a','b'] &gt;&gt;= \ch -&gt; return (n,ch)
[(1,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'a'),(2,'b')]
</pre>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/concatmap.png" alt="concatmap" class="left" width="399" height="340">

<p>
The list <span class="fixed">[1,2]</span> gets bound to <span
class="fixed">n</span> and <span class="fixed">['a','b']</span> gets bound to
<span class="fixed">ch</span>. Then, we do <span class="fixed">return (n,ch)</span> (or <span class="fixed">[(n,ch)]</span>),
which means taking a pair of <span class="fixed">(n,ch)</span> and putting it in
a default minimal context. In this case, it's making the smallest possible list
that still presents <span class="fixed">(n,ch)</span> as the result and features
as little non-determinism as possible. Its effect on the context is minimal.
What we're saying here is this: for every element in <span class="fixed">[1,2]</span>,
go over every element in <span class="fixed">['a','b']</span> and produce a
tuple of one element from each list.
</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, because <span class="fixed">return</span> takes a value and
wraps it  in a minimal context, it doesn't have any extra effect (like failing
in <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> or resulting in more non-determinism for
lists) but it does present something as its result.
</p>

<div class="hintbox">
When you have non-deterministic values interacting, you can view their
computation as a tree where every possible result in a list represents a
separate branch.
</div>

<p>
Here's the previous expression rewritten in <span class="fixed">do</span> notation:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
listOfTuples :: [(Int,Char)]
listOfTuples = do
    n &lt;- [1,2]
    ch &lt;- ['a','b']
    return (n,ch)
</pre>

<p>
This makes it a bit more obvious that <span class="fixed">n</span> takes on
every value from <span class="fixed">[1,2]</span> and <span
class="fixed">ch</span> takes on every value from <span
class="fixed">['a','b']</span>. Just like with <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>,
we're extracting the elements from the monadic values and treating them like
normal values and <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> takes care of the context
for us. The context in this case is non-determinism.
</p>

<p>
Using lists with <span class="fixed">do</span> notation really reminds me of
something we've seen before. Check out the following piece of code:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [ (n,ch) | n &lt;- [1,2], ch &lt;- ['a','b'] ]
[(1,'a'),(1,'b'),(2,'a'),(2,'b')]
</pre>

<p>
Yes! List comprehensions! In our <span class="fixed">do</span> notation example,
<span class="fixed">n</span> became every result from <span class="fixed">[1,2]</span>
and for every such result, <span class="fixed">ch</span> was assigned a result
from <span class="fixed">['a','b']</span> and then the final line put <span
class="fixed">(n,ch)</span> into a default context (a singleton list) to present
it as the result without introducing any additional non-determinism. In this
list comprehension, the same thing happened, only we didn't have to write
<span class="fixed">return</span> at the end to present <span
class="fixed">(n,ch)</span> as the result because the output part of a list
comprehension did that for us.
</p>

<p>
In fact, list comprehensions are just syntactic sugar for using lists as
monads. In the end, list comprehensions and lists in <span class="fixed">do</span>
notation translate to using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to do
computations that feature non-determinism.
</p>

<p>
List comprehensions allow us to filter our output. For instance, we can filter a
list of numbers to search only for that numbers whose digits contain a <span
class="fixed">7</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [ x | x &lt;- [1..50], '7' `elem` show x ]
[7,17,27,37,47]
</pre>

<p>
We apply <span class="fixed">show</span> to <span class="fixed">x</span> to turn
our number into a string and then we check if the character <span
class="fixed">'7'</span> is part of that string. Pretty clever. To see how
filtering in list comprehensions translates to the list monad, we have to check
out the <span class="fixed">guard</span> function and the <span
class="fixed">MonadPlus</span> type class. The <span class="fixed">MonadPlus</span>
type class is for monads that can also act as monoids. Here's its definition:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
class Monad m =&gt; MonadPlus m where
    mzero :: m a
    mplus :: m a -&gt; m a -&gt; m a
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">mzero</span> is synonymous to <span class="fixed">mempty</span>
from the <span class="fixed">Monoid</span> type class and <span
class="fixed">mplus</span> corresponds to <span class="fixed">mappend</span>.
Because lists are monoids as well as monads, they can be made an instance of
this type class:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
instance MonadPlus [] where
    mzero = []
    mplus = (++)
</pre>

<p>
For lists <span class="fixed">mzero</span> represents a non-deterministic
computation that has no results at all &mdash; a failed computation. <span
class="fixed">mplus</span> joins two non-deterministic values into one. The
<span class="fixed">guard</span> function is defined like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
guard :: (MonadPlus m) =&gt; Bool -&gt; m ()
guard True = return ()
guard False = mzero
</pre>

<p>
It takes a boolean value and if it's <span class="fixed">True</span>, takes a <span class="fixed">()</span> and puts it in a minimal default context
that still succeeds. Otherwise, it makes a failed monadic value. Here it is in
action:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) :: Maybe ()
Just ()
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) :: Maybe ()
Nothing
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) :: [()]
[()]
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) :: [()]
[]
</pre>

<p>
Looks interesting, but how is it useful? In the list monad, we use it to filter
out non-deterministic computations. Observe:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [1..50] &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; guard ('7' `elem` show x) &gt;&gt; return x)
[7,17,27,37,47]
</pre>

<p>
The result here is the same as the result of our previous list comprehension.
How does <span class="fixed">guard</span> achieve this? Let's first
see how <span class="fixed">guard</span> functions in conjunction with <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; guard (5 &gt; 2) &gt;&gt; return "cool" :: [String]
["cool"]
ghci&gt; guard (1 &gt; 2) &gt;&gt; return "cool" :: [String]
[]
</pre>

<p>
If <span class="fixed">guard</span> succeeds, the result contained within it
is an empty tuple. So then, we use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;</span> to ignore
that empty tuple and present something else as the result. However, if <span
class="fixed">guard</span> fails, then so will the <span
class="fixed">return</span> later on, because feeding an empty list to a
function with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> always results in an empty
list. A <span class="fixed">guard</span> basically says: if this boolean is
<span class="fixed">False</span> then produce a failure right here, otherwise
make a successful value that has a dummy result of <span class="fixed">()</span>
inside it. All this does is to allow the computation to continue.
</p>

<p>
Here's the previous example rewritten in <span class="fixed">do</span> notation:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
sevensOnly :: [Int]
sevensOnly = do
    x &lt;- [1..50]
    guard ('7' `elem` show x)
    return x
</pre>

<p>
Had we forgotten to present <span class="fixed">x</span> as the final result by
using <span class="fixed">return</span>, the resulting list would just be a list
of empty tuples. Here's this again in the form of a list comprehension:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; [ x | x &lt;- [1..50], '7' `elem` show x ]
[7,17,27,37,47]
</pre>

<p>
So filtering in list comprehensions is the same as using <span
class="fixed">guard</span>.
</p>

<h3>A knight's quest</h3>
<p>
Here's a problem that really lends itself to being solved with non-determinism.
Say you have a chess board and only one knight piece on it. We want to find out
if the knight can reach a certain position in three moves. We'll just use a pair
of numbers to represent the knight's position on the chess board. The first
number will determine the column he's in and the second number will determine
the row.
</p>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/chess.png" alt="hee haw im a horse" class="center" width="760" height="447">

<p>
Let's make a type synonym for the knight's current position on the chess board:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
type KnightPos = (Int,Int)
</pre>

<p>
So let's say that the knight starts at <span class="fixed">(6,2)</span>. Can he
get to <span class="fixed">(6,1)</span> in exactly three moves? Let's see. If we
start off at <span class="fixed">(6,2)</span> what's the best move to make next?
I know, how about all of them! We have non-determinism at our disposal, so
instead of picking one move, let's just pick all of them at once. Here's a
function that takes the knight's position and returns all of its next moves:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
moveKnight :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
moveKnight (c,r) = do
    (c',r') &lt;- [(c+2,r-1),(c+2,r+1),(c-2,r-1),(c-2,r+1)
               ,(c+1,r-2),(c+1,r+2),(c-1,r-2),(c-1,r+2)
               ]
    guard (c' `elem` [1..8] &amp;&amp; r' `elem` [1..8])
    return (c',r')
</pre>

<p>
The knight can always take one step horizontally or vertically and two steps
horizontally or vertically but its movement has to be both horizontal and
vertical. <span class="fixed">(c',r')</span> takes on every value from the list
of movements and then <span class="fixed">guard</span> makes sure that the new
move, <span class="fixed">(c',r')</span> is still on the board. If it's not,
it produces an empty list, which causes a failure and <span
class="fixed">return (c',r')</span> isn't carried out for that position.
</p>

<p>
This function can also be written without the use of lists as a monad, but we
did it here just for kicks. Here is the same function done with <span
class="fixed">filter</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
moveKnight :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
moveKnight (c,r) = filter onBoard
    [(c+2,r-1),(c+2,r+1),(c-2,r-1),(c-2,r+1)
    ,(c+1,r-2),(c+1,r+2),(c-1,r-2),(c-1,r+2)
    ]
    where onBoard (c,r) = c `elem` [1..8] &amp;&amp; r `elem` [1..8]
</pre>

<p>
Both of these do the same thing, so pick one that you think looks nicer. Let's
give it a whirl:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; moveKnight (6,2)
[(8,1),(8,3),(4,1),(4,3),(7,4),(5,4)]
ghci&gt; moveKnight (8,1)
[(6,2),(7,3)]
</pre>

<p>
Works like a charm! We take one position and we just carry out all the possible
moves at once, so to speak. So now that we have a non-deterministic next position,
we just use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed it to <span
class="fixed">moveKnight</span>. Here's a function that takes a position and
returns all the positions that you can reach from it in three moves:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
in3 :: KnightPos -&gt; [KnightPos]
in3 start = do
    first &lt;- moveKnight start
    second &lt;- moveKnight first
    moveKnight second
</pre>

<p>
If you pass it <span class="fixed">(6,2)</span>, the resulting list is quite
big, because if there are several ways to reach some position in three moves,
it crops up in the list several times. The above without <span
class="fixed">do</span> notation:
</p>


<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
in3 start = return start &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight &gt;&gt;= moveKnight
</pre>

<p>
Using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> once gives us all possible moves from
the start and then when we use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> the second
time, for every possible first move, every possible next move is computed, and
the same goes for the last move.
</p>

<p>
Putting a value in a default context by applying <span class="fixed">return</span>
to it and then feeding it to a function with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>
is the same as just normally applying the function to that value, but we did it
here anyway for style.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's make a function that takes two positions and tells us if you can
get from one to the other in exactly three steps:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
canReachIn3 :: KnightPos -&gt; KnightPos -&gt; Bool
canReachIn3 start end = end `elem` in3 start
</pre>

<p>
We generate all the possible positions in three steps and then we see if the
position we're looking for is among them. So let's see if we can get from
<span class="fixed">(6,2)</span> to <span class="fixed">(6,1)</span> in three
moves:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (6,2) `canReachIn3` (6,1)
True
</pre>

<p>
Yes! How about from <span class="fixed">(6,2)</span> to <span
class="fixed">(7,3)</span>?
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; (6,2) `canReachIn3` (7,3)
False
</pre>

<p>
No! As an exercise, you can change this function so that when you can reach one
position from the other, it tells you which moves to take. Later on, we'll see
how to modify this function so that we also pass it the number of moves to take
instead of that number being hardcoded like it is now.

<h2>Monad laws</h2>

<img src="assets/images/a-fistful-of-monads/judgedog.png" alt="the court finds you guilty of peeing all over
everything" class="right" width="343" height="170">

<p>
Just like applicative functors, and functors before them, monads come with a few
laws that all monad instances must abide by. Just because something is made an
instance of the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> type class doesn't mean that
it's a monad, it just means that it was made an instance of a type class. For
a type to truly be a monad, the monad laws must hold for that type. These laws
allow us to make reasonable assumptions about the type and its behavior.
</p>

<p>
Haskell allows any type to be an instance of any type class as long as the types check
out. It can't check if the monad laws hold for a type though, so if we're making
a new instance of the <span class="fixed">Monad</span> type class, we have to be
reasonably sure that all is well with the monad laws for that type. We can rely
on the types that come with the standard library to satisfy the laws, but later
when we go about making our own monads, we're going to have to manually check
if the laws hold. But don't worry, they're not complicated.
</p>

<h3>Left identity</h3>

<p>
The first monad law states that if we take a value, put it in a default
context with <span class="fixed">return</span> and then feed it to a function by
using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, it's the same as just taking the
value and applying the function to it. To put it formally:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="label law">return x &gt;&gt;= f</span> is the same damn
    thing as <span class="label law">f x</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
If you look at monadic values as values with a context and <span
class="fixed">return</span> as taking a value and putting it in a default
minimal context that still presents that value as its result, it makes sense,
because if that context is really minimal, feeding this monadic value to a
function shouldn't be much different than just applying the function to the
normal value, and indeed it isn't different at all.
</p>

<p>
For the <span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad <span class="fixed">return</span>
is defined as <span class="fixed">Just</span>. The <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>
monad is all about possible failure, and if we have a value and want to put it
in such a context, it makes sense that we treat it as a successful computation
because, well, we know what the value is. Here's some <span
class="fixed">return</span> usage with <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return 3 &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; Just (x+100000))
Just 100003
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; Just (x+100000)) 3
Just 100003
</pre>

<p>
For the list monad <span class="fixed">return</span> puts something in a
singleton list. The <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> implementation for
lists goes over all the values in the list and applies the function to them, but
since there's only one value in a singleton list, it's the same as applying the
function to that value:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return "WoM" &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; [x,x,x])
["WoM","WoM","WoM"]
ghci&gt; (\x -&gt; [x,x,x]) "WoM"
["WoM","WoM","WoM"]
</pre>

<p>
We said that for <span class="fixed">IO</span>, using <span
class="fixed">return</span> makes an I/O action that has no side-effects but
just presents a value as its result. So it makes sense that this law holds for
<span class="fixed">IO</span> as well.
</p>

<h3>Right identity</h3>

<p>
The second law states that if we have a monadic value and we use <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to feed it to <span class="fixed">return</span>,
the result is our original monadic value. Formally:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><span class="label law">m &gt;&gt;= return</span> is no different than
    just <span class="label law">m</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
This one might be a bit less obvious than the first one, but let's take a look
at why it should hold. When we feed monadic values to functions by using <span
class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, those functions take normal values and return
monadic ones. <span class="fixed">return</span> is also one such function, if
you consider its type. Like we said, <span class="fixed">return</span> puts a
value in a minimal context that still presents that value as its result. This
means that, for instance, for <span class="fixed">Maybe</span>, it doesn't
introduce any failure and for lists, it doesn't introduce any extra
non-determinism. Here's a test run for a few monads:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; Just "move on up" &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
Just "move on up"
ghci&gt; [1,2,3,4] &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
[1,2,3,4]
ghci&gt; putStrLn "Wah!" &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; return x)
Wah!
</pre>

<p>
If we take a closer look at the list example, the implementation for
<span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> is:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
xs &gt;&gt;= f = concat (map f xs)
</pre>

<p>
So when we feed <span class="fixed">[1,2,3,4]</span> to
<span class="fixed">return</span>, first <span class="fixed">return</span>
gets mapped over <span class="fixed">[1,2,3,4]</span>, resulting in
<span class="fixed">[[1],[2],[3],[4]]</span> and then this gets concatenated and
we have our original list.
</p>

<p>
Left identity and right identity are basically laws that describe how <span
class="fixed">return</span> should behave. It's an important function for
making normal values into monadic ones and it wouldn't be good if the monadic
value that it produced did a lot of other stuff.
</p>

<h3>Associativity</h3>

<p>
The final monad law says that when we have a chain of monadic function
applications with <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, it shouldn't matter how
they're nested. Formally written:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Doing <span class="label law">(m &gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g</span> is just like
    doing <span class="label law">m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Hmmm, now what's going on here? We have one monadic value, <span
class="fixed">m</span> and two monadic functions <span class="fixed">f</span>
and <span class="fixed">g</span>. When we're doing <span class="fixed">(m
&gt;&gt;= f) &gt;&gt;= g</span>, we're feeding <span class="fixed">m</span> to <span class="fixed">f</span>, which results in a monadic value. Then, we feed that monadic value to <span class="fixed">g</span>.
In the expression <span class="fixed">m &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt; f x &gt;&gt;= g)</span>, we take a
monadic value and we feed it to a function that feeds the result of <span
class="fixed">f x</span> to <span class="fixed">g</span>. It's not easy to see
how those two are equal, so let's take a look at an example that makes this
equality a bit clearer.
</p>

<p>
Remember when we had our tightrope walker Pierre walk a rope while birds landed
on his balancing pole? To simulate birds landing on his balancing pole, we
made a chain of several functions that might produce failure:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2 &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2 &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)
</pre>

<p>
We started with <span class="fixed">Just (0,0)</span> and then bound that value
to the next monadic function, <span class="fixed">landRight 2</span>. The result
of that was another monadic value which got bound into the next
monadic function, and so on. If we were to explicitly parenthesize this, we'd
write:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; ((return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2) &gt;&gt;= landLeft 2) &gt;&gt;= landRight 2
Just (2,4)
</pre>

<p>
But we can also write the routine like this:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
return (0,0) &gt;&gt;= (\x -&gt;
landRight 2 x &gt;&gt;= (\y -&gt;
landLeft 2 y &gt;&gt;= (\z -&gt;
landRight 2 z)))
</pre>

<p>
<span class="fixed">return (0,0)</span> is the same as
<span class="fixed">Just (0,0)</span> and when we feed it to the lambda,
the <span class="fixed">x</span> becomes <span class="fixed">(0,0)</span>.
<span class="fixed">landRight</span> takes a number of birds and a pole (a tuple
of numbers) and that's what it gets passed. This results in a <span
class="fixed">Just (0,2)</span> and when we feed this to the next lambda,
<span class="fixed">y</span> is <span class="fixed">(0,2)</span>. This goes on
until the final bird landing produces a <span class="fixed">Just (2,4)</span>,
which is indeed the result of the whole expression.
</p>

<p>
So it doesn't matter how you nest feeding values to monadic functions, what
matters is their meaning. Here's another way to look at this law: consider
composing two functions, <span class="fixed">f</span> and <span
class="fixed">g</span>. Composing two functions is implemented like so:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(.) :: (b -&gt; c) -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; (a -&gt; c)
f . g = (\x -&gt; f (g x))
</pre>

<p>
If the type of <span class="fixed">g</span> is <span class="fixed">a -&gt; b</span>
and the type of <span class="fixed">f</span> is <span class="fixed">b -&gt; c</span>,
we arrange them into a new function which has a type of <span
class="fixed">a -&gt; c</span>, so that its parameter is passed between those
functions. Now what if those two functions were monadic, that is, what if the
values they returned were monadic values? If we had a function of type
<span class="fixed">a -&gt; m b</span>, we couldn't just pass its result to a
function of type <span class="fixed">b -&gt; m c</span>, because that function
accepts a normal <span class="fixed">b</span>, not a monadic one. We could
however, use <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span> to make that happen. So by
using <span class="fixed">&gt;&gt;=</span>, we can compose two monadic
functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
(&lt;=&lt;) :: (Monad m) =&gt; (b -&gt; m c) -&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; (a -&gt; m c)
f &lt;=&lt; g = (\x -&gt; g x &gt;&gt;= f)
</pre>

<p>
So now we can compose two monadic functions:
</p>

<pre name="code" class="haskell:hs">
ghci&gt; let f x = [x,-x]
ghci&gt; let g x = [x*3,x*2]
ghci&gt; let h = f &lt;=&lt; g
ghci&gt; h 3
[9,-9,6,-6]
</pre>

<p>
Cool. So what does that have to do with the associativity law? Well, when we
look at the law as a law of compositions, it states that
<span class="label law">f &lt;=&lt; (g &lt;=&lt; h)</span> should be the same as
<span class="label law">(f &lt;=&lt; g) &lt;=&lt; h</span>. This is just another
way of saying that for monads, the nesting of operations shouldn't matter.
</p>

<p>
If we translate the first two laws to use <span class="fixed">&lt;=&lt;</span>,
then the left identity law states that for every monadic function <span class="fixed">f</span>,
<span class="label law">f &lt;=&lt; return</span>
is the same as writing just <span class="label law">f</span> and the right identity law
says that <span class="label law">return &lt;=&lt; f</span> is also no different from
<span class="label law">f</span>.
</p>

<p>
This is very similar to how if <span class="fixed">f</span>
is a normal function, <span class="fixed">(f . g) . h</span> is the same as <span class="fixed">f . (g . h)</span>, <span class="fixed">f . id</span>
is always the same as <span class="fixed">f</span> and <span class="fixed">id .
f</span>
is also just <span class="fixed">f</span>.
</p>

<p>
In this chapter, we took a look at the basics of monads and learned how the
<span class="fixed">Maybe</span> monad and the list monad work. In the next
chapter, we'll take a look at a whole bunch of other cool monads and we'll also
learn how to make our own.
